*** Build instructions for native asasm:

1. Generate the configuration files.
   This should only be done once for a freshly checked output source tree.

   $ cd asasm
   $ autoreconf --install

2. Create build output directory (preferably outside the source directory):
   E.g. at the same level where the source directory is located.

   $ mkdir ../build-output
   $ cd ../build-output

3. Create Makefile in the build output directory:

   $ ../asasm/configure --target=arm-unknown-riscos

   If you're not interested to run the asasm tests, you don't need to
   build the elftoolchain tools, so you can additionally specify
   --disable-building-tools

   Also you can specify --prefix=<installdir> with <installdir> a full path
   of the intended installation directory (used when 'make install' is done).

4. Compile and link asasm:

   $ make

5. Test:

   $ cd ../asasm/regression
   $ make check

   When all the tests are successful, you should see at the near end:

   *** All tests were OK (do 'make clean' if you want to re-do them)

6. Install:

   $ cd ../../build-output/asasm
   $ sudo make install

*** Build instructions for cross-compiled asasm:

1. Generate the configuration files:
   This should only be done once for a freshly checked output source tree.

   $ cd asasm
   $ autoreconf --install

2. Create build output directory (preferably outside the source directory):
   E.g. at the same level where the source directory is located.

   $ mkdir ../build-output-ro
   $ cd ../build-output-ro

3. Setup cross-compile environment if necessary.  For GCCSDK (using SCL):

   $ PATH=$GCCSDK_INSTALL_CROSSBIN:$PATH
   $ export CFLAGS=-mlibscl

4. Create Makefile in the build output directory (indicating which
   cross-compiler needs to be used):

   $ ../asasm/configure --host=arm-unknown-riscos --target=arm-unknown-riscos \
   --disable-building-tools

   Also you can specify --prefix=<installdir> with <installdir> a full path
   of the intended installation directory (used when 'make install' is done).

5. Cross-compile and link asasm:

   $ make

   You have now a RISC OS version of asasm:

   $ file asasm
   asasm: RISC OS AIF executable
