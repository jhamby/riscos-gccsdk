\chapter{Using The Build System}\label{chap.userguide}

In this chapter we will look at how to use the system.

\section{Terminology}

A \definition{build configuration} is specification of the steps need
to invoke complete a build; i.e., the list of machines to be invoked,
the scheduling logic for invoking these machines, the specific tasks
be invoked inside each virtual machine, the results to retrieve, and
so on.

A \definition{build run} is an invocation of a \term{build
  configuration}.

A \definition{build scheduler} is a script that implements the logic
for scheduling the machines that are part of the build.

A \definition{build slave} is a physical or virtual machine that
participates in a build.

A \definition{slave script} is a script that lists the actions to
be executed in a virtual machine.

\section{Configuration}
