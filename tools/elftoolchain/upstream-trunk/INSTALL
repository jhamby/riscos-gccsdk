Building the Source Tree
========================

The core libraries and utilities that make up the software release are
always built by default.  Builds of the project's test suites (in the
``test/`` subdirectory), and of additional documentation (in the
directory ``documentation/``) are optional and will only be attempted
if these directories are present.

Prerequisites
-------------

:DragonFly BSD 2.10.1:
    - The core libraries and utilities should build out of the box on
      a stock install of DragonFly BSD.

    - To build and run the test suite:

      #. The current release of the `Test Execution Toolkit`_ needs to
         be downloaded and unpacked into the ``test/tet/`` directory.

      #. The ``py26-yaml`` package needs to be installed::

            % sudo pkgin install py26-yaml

    - Building additional documentation is not currently supported
      under DragonFly BSD.

         be downloaded and unpacked into the ``test/tet/`` directory.

      #. The ``py-yaml`` package needs to be installed::

            % sudo pkg_add -r py-yaml

Building the software
---------------------

The software may be built by running **make**.

On `DragonFly BSD`_,  FreeBSD_, Minix_, NetBSD_ and OpenBSD_, use::

  % make

On Ubuntu GNU/Linux with the **pmake** package installed, use::

  % pmake


Testing the software
---------------------

The ``run-tests`` target in the top-level Makefile will build and
execute the test suites that are part of this software.

On `DragonFly BSD`_, FreeBSD_ and NetBSD_, use::

    % make run-tests

On Ubuntu GNU/Linux with the **pmake** package installed, use::

    % pmake run-tests

Installing the Software
=======================

The software may be installed using the ``install`` target.

On `DragonFly BSD`_, FreeBSD_, Minix_, NetBSD_ and OpenBSD_ use::

    % make install

On Ubuntu GNU/Linux with the **pmake** package installed, use::

    % pmake install


By default the ``install`` target will install utilities into
``/usr/bin/``, libraries into ``/usr/lib/`` and manual pages into
``/usr/share/man/man[0-9]/``.

The installation directory may be changed using the ``DESTDIR``
variable.  For example::

    % pmake DESTDIR=$HOME/local install
