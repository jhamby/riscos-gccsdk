Sargasso - RSS feed reader
http://zamez.org/sargasso

Sargasso is a viewer for RSS feeds. RSS is a format for syndicating news
and the content of news-like sites. To find out more, see

  http://www.xml.com/pub/a/2002/12/18/dive-into-xml.html

After starting Sargasso, the main window showing your feeds will open.
Sargasso will fetch the feeds and show a count of items in each. Click on a
feed to read it.

Click on an item in a feed window to go to the web page associated with
that item.

To add a feed, click menu in the main window, choose "Add feed...", and enter
the URL of the feed (these are often linked on web pages with an orange "RSS"
icon). To remove a feed, use the menu in the main window.

Choose "Update feeds" from the menu to check your feeds for new items.
Items that are new since you last looked at the feed contents are shown in
bold.
