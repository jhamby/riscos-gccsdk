This is Enhanced CTorrent, a client for BitTorrent filesharing.

Installing
----------

Place the ctorrent binary anywhere you like - somewhere in the Run$Path
or Library may be sensible.


Usage
-----

ctorrent is normally invoked in a TaskWindow.  First find a .torrent file for
the download you want, and save it on your machine with your web browser or
wget, for example:

 *wget http://releases.ubuntu.com/6.10/ubuntu-6.10-desktop-i386.iso.torrent
then invoke ctorrent
 *ctorrent ubuntu-6.10-desktop-i386.iso.torrent

Note dots in this filename, not slashes.  It will proceed to find other
servers and download.  If you're behind a firewall, BitTorrent is often
accelerated if you open or forward ports so that other servers can reach your
machine.  As BitTorrent is a sharing medium, it's polite to leave ctorrent
running for a time after you've got the whole file so others can download the
file from you.  You can set which ports ctorrent listens on with command line
options.

See the accompanying documentation for more complex use, and for explanation
of the progress displays.
