Description:  BitTorrent is a scaleable and efficient system for
 distributing files over the Internet. It does this by downloading pieces of
 the file from many different sources (peers) simultaneously and puts the
 pieces back together into the original file. Since it shares the load
 between many peers, there is no need for a central server with massive
 resources, unlike older solutions such as the File Transfer Protocol (FTP).
 This method for sharing files is commonly known as Peer-To-Peer (P2P)
 filesharing. Like most things, P2P too has some "downsides", since you are
 one of the peers, you will also have to share (or else it wouldn't work!).
 This is not necessarily a bad thing, but many users feel that they
 shouldn't have to share in order to download. BitTorrent will share
 whatever pieces of the file you've already downloaded as long as you are
 downloading yourself. All clients created for the BitTorrent network work
 in this fashion, CTorrent is no exception.
 .
 CTorrent is a BitTorrent client written in the C++ programming language. 
 It is built as a console program, which means that it doesn't require any
 graphical components (such as an X server) on the machine you are running
 it on, you can even run it remotely through a terminal if you wish.  While
 a lot of people prefer a GUI (Graphical User Interface) for this kind of
 applications, there are quite a few people who run "console only" servers
 and want to use them to download files in the background. CTorrent can help
 you do exactly this, assuming you are downloading from the BitTorrent
 network.
 .
 This is a port of Enhanced CTorrent, which has several bug fixes and
 improvements over the original CTorrent.
