                 Visual Basic .net Compiler
                 --------------------------

This is the Mono Visual Basic .net Compiler. It requires the RISC OS
Mono runtime which is available in a separate package.

Installation
------------
The compiler and its resources are provided in a skeleton !Mono
application directory that can be dragged over an existing Mono
installation.

Using the compiler
------------------
When installed, the compiler can be invoked at the command line by
the name 'vbnc'. Source files should have a '.vb' suffix and output
files '.exe'.

Please see the !ReadMe file within the full !Mono directory for more
details of how to use RISC OS Mono.
