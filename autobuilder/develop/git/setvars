# Package function

# You will need to define this to do your packaging for RiscPkg. 
# There are several variables to use here:
# $S build directory
# $D top level of destination package directory
# $H autobuilder directory for package
# $A RISC OS application (after calling ab_create_app, etc)
#
#ab_package () {
#   ab_create_app MyApp Apps/Graphics     # !MyApp will be copied from $H, and the package section will be Graphics
#   ab_add_commands $S/myapp${AB_EXEEXT}  # For applications containing command line utilities, this adds aliases to !Boot 

#   $AB_HOME/add-riscpkg -unixlib         # Last step to complete packaging
