Git - the stupid content tracker

////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

"git" can mean anything, depending on your mood.

 - random three-letter combination that is pronounceable, and not
   actually used by any common UNIX command.  The fact that it is a
   mispronunciation of "get" may or may not be relevant.
 - stupid. contemptible and despicable. simple. Take your pick from the
   dictionary of slang.
 - "global information tracker": you're in a good mood, and it actually
   works for you. Angels sing, and a light suddenly fills the room.
 - "goddamn idiotic truckload of sh*t": when it breaks

Git is a fast, scalable, distributed revision control system with an
unusually rich command set that provides both high-level operations
and full access to internals.

Git is an Open Source project covered by the GNU General Public
License version 2 (some parts of it are under different licenses,
compatible with the GPLv2). It was originally written by Linus
Torvalds with help of a group of hackers around the net.

This is the RISC OS port of the command lines tools - see the end
of the file for details.

See Documentation/gittutorial.txt to get started, then see
Documentation/everyday.txt for a useful minimum set of commands, and
Documentation/git-commandname.txt for documentation of each command.
If git has been correctly installed, then the tutorial can also be
read with "man gittutorial" or "git help tutorial", and the
documentation of each command with "man git-commandname" or "git help
commandname".

CVS users may also want to read Documentation/gitcvs-migration.txt
("man gitcvs-migration" or "git help cvs-migration" if git is
installed).

Many Git online resources are accessible from http://git-scm.com/
including full documentation and Git related tools.

The user discussion and development of Git take place on the Git
mailing list -- everyone is welcome to post bug reports, feature
requests, comments and patches to git@vger.kernel.org (read
Documentation/SubmittingPatches for instructions on patch submission).
To subscribe to the list, send an email with just "subscribe git" in
the body to majordomo@vger.kernel.org. The mailing list archives are
available at http://news.gmane.org/gmane.comp.version-control.git/,
http://marc.info/?l=git and other archival sites.

The maintainer frequently sends the "What's cooking" reports that
list the current status of various development topics to the mailing
list.  The discussion following them give a good reference for
project status, development direction and remaining tasks.

RISC OS Port notes
==================

To get to the text documentation Shift+Select the !Git directory
to enter it and look in the Documentation directory.

Warning: git currently does not appear to work on a HostFS based
filing system.


Usage
~~~~~
Make sure !Git has been booted, then use it as you would use the command
line client under unix. All filenames should be specified in unix
format, rather than RISC OS format, eg git diff foo/bar.c rather than
git diff foo.c.bar

Prerequisites
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The SharedUnixLibrary module
ftp://gccsdk.riscos.info/pub/gcc/latest/system.zip

Log mesages
~~~~~~~~~~~
You should generally use the -m or -F options on the command line to
specify log messages when committing files. The use of a text editor
is currently untested.

Filetypes
~~~~~~~~~
Git stores file types as a ,xyz type extension to the
filename.

If you wish a file's filetype to be retained when it is added to a
repository, then you should specify its name with a comma and hex
filetype appended, in the same way as John Tytgat's CVS port works. e.g.
svn add !Boot
Adds the file !Boot without any filetype information. When it is checked
out from the repository, it will have its filetype set to text.
svn add !Boot,feb
Adds the file !Boot, with the filetype &feb (Obey). The file will retain
its filetype when it is checked out.

Known problems
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
It has various file access problems when the host repository is HostFS.
git help fails as there is no man program to show the pages.
