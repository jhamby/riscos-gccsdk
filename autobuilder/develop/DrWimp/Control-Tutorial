Description: An application framework for RISC OS programs written in BBC BASIC
 The Doctor Wimp package comprises a set of utilities and a function library
 designed to make multi-tasking desktop (Wimp) programming very easy for
 anyone reasonably familiar with BBC Basic.
 .
 As an example, to get an application to put an icon on the iconbar, open a
 window when clicked on and provide an iconbar menu takes roughly 16k of
 Basic user-coding by normal methods.  Using DrWimp, the same thing can be
 done easily and reliably with just a few lines of user-code - still using
 Basic i.e. no need to learn another language.
