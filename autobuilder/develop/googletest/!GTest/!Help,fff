Google C++ Testing Framework
============================

http://code.google.com/p/googletest/

Overview
--------

Google's framework for writing C++ tests on a variety of platforms
(Linux, Mac OS X, Windows, Windows CE, Symbian, etc).  Based on the
xUnit architecture.  Supports automatic test discovery, a rich set of
assertions, user-defined assertions, death tests, fatal and non-fatal
failures, various options for running the tests, and XML test report
generation.

Please see the project page above for more information as well as the
mailing list for questions, discussions, and development.  There is
also an IRC channel on OFTC (irc.oftc.net) #gtest available.  Please
join us!

Requirements for End Users
--------------------------

Google Test is designed to have fairly minimal requirements to build
and use with your projects, but there are some.  Currently, we support
Linux, Windows, Mac OS X, and Cygwin.  We will also make our best
effort to support other platforms (e.g. Solaris, AIX, and z/OS).
However, since core members of the Google Test project have no access
to these platforms, Google Test may have outstanding issues there.  If
you notice any problems on your platform, please notify
googletestframework@googlegroups.com.  Patches for fixing them are
even more welcome!


RISC OS Notes
-------------

The original documents (including the README where the first paragraphs
of this help file came from) are in the docs subdirectory of !GTest.

Unfortunately with the current version of GCC (4.7.4) on RISC OS you
can not build the Google test files without running out of memory.

Due to this I have included pre-compiled libraries:
libgtest.a - the library without a main function
libgtest_main.a - the library with a main function

You can then link them to your project with
 -LGTest: -lgtest
or
 -LGTest: -lgtest_main

to include the headers add -IGTest: to your compile line.

If you are using the GCCSDK autobuilder compiler you an build
gtest as part of your project.

Building gtest with the autobuilder places the files in the
following locations:

The headers are installed in $(GCCSDK_INSTALL_ENV)/include
and the src code is installed at $(GCCSDK_INSTALL_ENV)/src/gtest/src

See the examples/make/Makefile.cross for examples of how to build it.
