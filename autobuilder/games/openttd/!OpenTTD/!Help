OpenTTD, RISC OS port version 0.7.3
Peter Naulls - 4th Nov 2009

This is a RISC OS port of OpenTTD, which is itself a clone of Transport
Tycoon Deluxe.

The original port of version of 0.4.1 in 2005 was by David Llewellyn-Jones.
This is an updated port to version 0.7.3.  There are no functional
changes for RISC OS, but the 0.7.3 is version has substantial improvements
and runs considerably faster on RISC OS.

The website for the RISC OS version of OpenTTD is:

http://www.riscos.info/index.php/OpenTTD

OpenTTD is built with the GCCSDK Autobuilder; refer to that for source
and patches.

IMPORTANT: OpenTTD requires original game data files to work (see below).
Free replacements are nearly complete and will be included in the next
release.


The text below is David's introduction to version 0.4.1

  =======================================================================
  OpenTTD is licensed under the GPL (see section 1.0 below for more info).
  However, in order to use the game, you will need the data files from the
  original commercial Transport Tycoon Deluxe (see section 4.0 below).

  It is likely that bugs have been introduced during the conversion process to
  RISC OS. I apologise if this is the case. However, all credit for the game
  must go to Chris Sawyer, the OpenTTD developers and to the many developers of
  RISC OS libraries that have made it possible to run the game on RISC OS.

  For more information, see the official OpenTTD website:

  The RISC OS binary and sourcceode for compilation of the RISC OS version can
  be obtained from my website.
