OpenTTD, RISC OS port version 0.7.5 (approx)
Peter Naulls - 25th Dev 2009

This is a RISC OS port of OpenTTD, which is itself a clone of Transport
Tycoon Deluxe.

The original port of version of 0.4.1 in 2005 was by David Llewellyn-Jones.

I made an updated port to version 0.7.3 in November 2009, which was
functionally similar for RISC OS, but ran considerably faster.

This is a development snapshot, made for the 2009 riscos.info Christmas
games release.  The main difference with this version is that it now
includes 100% free graphics and sound replacements, and no long requires
separate data file downloads.

The website for the RISC OS version of OpenTTD is:

http://www.riscos.info/index.php/OpenTTD

OpenTTD is built with the GCCSDK Autobuilder; refer to that for source
and patches.



The text below is David's introduction to version 0.4.1

  =======================================================================
  OpenTTD is licensed under the GPL (see section 1.0 below for more info).
  However, in order to use the game, you will need the data files from the
  original commercial Transport Tycoon Deluxe (see section 4.0 below).

  It is likely that bugs have been introduced during the conversion process to
  RISC OS. I apologise if this is the case. However, all credit for the game
  must go to Chris Sawyer, the OpenTTD developers and to the many developers of
  RISC OS libraries that have made it possible to run the game on RISC OS.

  For more information, see the official OpenTTD website:

  The RISC OS binary and sourcceode for compilation of the RISC OS version can
  be obtained from my website.
