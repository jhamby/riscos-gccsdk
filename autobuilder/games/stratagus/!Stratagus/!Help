Read 'doc/index.html' for general information and license information.
Read 'doc/ChangeLog.html' for the Stratagus changelog.


RISC OS Notes
-------------

Version 2.2 Ported by Alan Buckley 1st September 2008.
Version 2.1 Ported by Alan Buckley 8th February 2005.

This is the game engine only to play any games the games must be downloaded
separately. See the end of this document for how to set up games under
RISC OS.

This is a binary distribution for RISC OS.

The installation instructions in 'doc/install.html' do not apply to this
binary distribution.

This program is 32-bit compatible, and is suitable for all RISC OS
ARM6, ARM7, StrongARM and XScale machines.  It may not be suitable for
earlier machines.

Switch to fullscreen mode to increase the speed. If the sound breaks up or
you need more speed for a particular game turn off the sound in the game
menus.

The program needs a lot of memory possibly over 64MB.

The Digital Renderer module (available from http://home.t-online.de/~zarquon)
must be installed in System:Modules for sound playback.

The !UnixHome application (available from http://www.riscos.info/packages/) has
to have been seen by the filer.

See www.stratagus.org for more information on the engine and links to
download games.


Setting up a game
-----------------

Download the game and unpack it to a directory.

Create an obey file to run the game which does the following:

1. Check that the Stratagus engine has been seen
2. Set up a path variable to the directory
3. Run the <Stratagus$Dir>.RunStrat program passing the location of the
   data file using the -d option. It is also recommended that you use
   the -D 16 option to set the display to fullscreen 16bpp.

See the RunBOS example obey file provided here that can be used with
the Battle of Survival game.

If you want the game to run on a double click, make the folder into
an application folder by renaming it to a name starting with a "!"
and name the Obey file to run the engine to !Run.

If nothing happens you can modify the RunStrat script to log the
output and error (there is a commented out line in the script that
shows how to do this) and check the log file for errors.


Compiling RISC OS version from source
-------------------------------------

Both stratagus and a patched version of lua50 can be recompiled using
the autobuilder scripts

(see http://www.riscos.info/index.php/GCCSDK#GCCSDK_Autobuilder for
details).
