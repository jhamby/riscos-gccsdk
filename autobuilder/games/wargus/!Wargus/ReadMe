The files provided in this folder are to help setup the Wargus game that
uses the Stratagus engine on RISC OS.

You need to own a legal copy of the Warcraft2 CD ROM.
(original DOS Version).

See http://wargus.sourceforge.net for details.

You also need a copy of the Stratagus engine for RISC OS. A precompiled
version to go with the !Run obey file provided here is available from
the GCCSDK Autobuilder website (address below).

Instructions
------------

1. Go into the !wargus directory (This is the same location as this ReadMe)

2. Ensure the ARCHIVE and WTARCHIVE variables in the BuildRO obey file
are correct for your CDROM drive.

3. Run BuildRO (You should be able to double click on it to run it).
If you have any problems try starting a TaskWindow and running it
in there.

4. Wait for the Obey file to finish.

5. Ensure !Stratagus has been seen by the filer and
then run !wargus to play.

Notes
-----

The tool to extract the files from the CD (wartool) was built by
the GCCSDK Autobuilder.
