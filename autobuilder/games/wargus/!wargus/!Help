Wargus 2.1
----------

This is a game that uses the Stratagus game engine, so the !Stratagus
application must have been seen before it is run.

See http://wargus.sourceforge.net for details of the game.

You should have also installed the files as documented in the ReadMe
that came with this application before it can be run on RISC OS.
