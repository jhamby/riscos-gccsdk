
Battle for Westnoth
-------------------

RISC OS port improvements for 1.4.5 and later by Christopher Martin

1st October 2008.

(The 1.4.5 version on the autobuilder website was currently built
using GCC 3.4.6 on Christopher's machine. The patches he used
have been added to the autobuilder and it is hoped that a
runnable version compiled by GCC4 will be available in future.)
 
RISC OS port for the autobuilder by Alan Buckley

10th July 2007

An earlier version was ported to RISC OS by Peter Naulls
on 23rd December 2004 as part of the Unix Porting Project, for its
Xmas 2004 games porting promotion. See the following URL for more
details: http://www.drobe.co.uk/riscos/artifact1242.html

Because of the CPU and graphical demands of Battle for Wesnoth,
running it on a RiscPC will not be very satisfactory.  To get the most from the game, you will need an Iyonix.

It has not been tested it on an A9Home so I can not comment on
its speed on this machine.

I recommend you run the game at 800x600 (see the configuration)
and full screen and turn the music off.

Known problems:
1. It can take a long time to load at startup, load a scenario,
   save games and quit.   
2. The music is choppy.


The recipe to build this game is in the autobuilder.
