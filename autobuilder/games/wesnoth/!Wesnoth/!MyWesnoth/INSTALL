Before you run Wesnoth, you must have a properly set-up !MyWesnoth.

!MyWesnoth isn't really an application. It provides somewhere for
Wesnoth to keep user-specific data such as preferences and saved games.

The master copy of !MyWesnoth lives inside the !Wesnoth application
folder. You should, at this moment, be able to see it on-screen.

You must do the following once: Make a copy of !MyWesnoth somewhere in
your private folders. (Copy it; do not move it.) When you make your own
copy of !MyWesnoth, there are several considerations:

 (1) Each Wesnoth player should have their own copy.

 (2) Your copy must be in a filesystem that allows long filenames.

 (3) Ensure that your copy is writeable. Wesnoth will try to create
     files and folders inside it. Don't put your copy in a read-only
     filesystem.

 (4) Don't put your copy in a compressed image filesystem (eg. SparkFS).

 (5) Double-click your copy (to activate it) before running !Wesnoth.

Then, every time you want to run !Wesnoth, you should first be sure that
your own copy of !MyWesnoth is active. The simplest way to do this is by
double-clicking your !MyWesnoth before double-clicking !Wesnoth. Or you
could write an Obey script that first runs your !MyWesnoth then runs
!Wesnoth.

If you are the only person who uses your computer, then you could simply
keep !MyWesnoth where the Filer will see it before you run !Wesnoth.
