Notes for RISC OS

   The version of Pingus first generated when this help file
   was written (Sept 2011) needs a lot of memory to run and
   may be too slow on anything older than an Iyonix.

   You can try tweaking the command line parameters in the !Run
   file to see if you can increase the speed.

   Switching to full screen mode (F11) often helps.

   It can currently get to a maximum of about 14fps on an Iyonix.

   I suspect it may still crash occasionally as it is a beta and
   may still run out of memory. Usually restarting the game lets
   you continue from the start of the screen where you left off.
