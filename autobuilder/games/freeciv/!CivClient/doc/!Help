freeciv for RISC OS (SDL Client)
================================

Added to the gccsdk autobuilder at version 2.1.5.

1.4.1-devel was Ported by Peter Naulls (unix@chocky.org)

This version of freeciv was built by the GCCSDK autobuilder and is
released on the autobuilder website: http://www.riscos.info/packages


Please note
-----------

This program is 32-bit compatible, and is suitable for all RISC OS
ARM6, ARM7, StrongARM and XScale machines.  It may not be suitable for
earlier machines.

If not installed using !RiscPkg you will also need to download the
UnixFont application and copy the ttf-dejavu-core archive over it.
!UnixFont must have been seen by the filer.

Currently the Start option from the client menu is not implemented
on RISC OS.

Usage
-----

This is a port of the SDL client of Freeciv to RISC OS.  this version
is based upon a current CVS version, and may have various display issues
(also present on other platforms).

Quick start:

  Run !CivServer
  Run !CivClient
  Click "Join Game"
  Click "Connect"
  Type "start" in the server taskwindow
  Choose your nation in the client, then click "start".


Other notes:

  If you double-click !UnixHome and edit the file !UserRC, you can
  add at the end:

    Set UnixEnv$USER peter

  Or similar to give yourself a sensible unix style username.  


  Not quitting the client properly may cause no sound when running
  subsequent SDL games.  "*RMReinit DigitalRenderer" is a temporary
  work around.
