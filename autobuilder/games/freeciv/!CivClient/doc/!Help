freeciv for RISC OS (SDL Client)
================================

Port by Peter Naulls <peter@chocky.org> and Alan Buckley.

This version of freeciv was built by the GCCSDK autobuilder and is
released on the autobuilder website: http://www.riscos.info/packages


== Under RISC OS ==

When you start a single player game, a local server will be started in a
taskwindow.  Under other systems this server would typically be invisible,
so you are free to minimize this.
