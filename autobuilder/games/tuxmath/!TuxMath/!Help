"Tux, of Math Command"
An educational math tutorial game starring Tux, the Linux Penguin
-----------------------------------------------------------------

September 2, 2001


Objective
---------
  In "Tux, of Math Command," you play the part of Commander Tux, as he
  defends his cities from an attack of math equations.

  Comets are crashing towards your cities, and you must destroy
  them by solving their equations.


Command Line Options
--------------------
  The following command-line options can be sent to the program.

    --fullscreen    -  Run the game in full screen, instead of in a window,
    -f                 if possible.

    --nosound       -  Do not play any sounds or music.
    -s
    --quiet
    -q

    --nobackground  -  Do not display photographic backgrounds in game.
    -b                 (Useful on slower systems.)

    --keypad        -  Display an on-screen numeric keypad.  (Useful
    -k                 for touch screens or in place of a physical keyboard.)

    --operator OP   -  Add an operator to the game (will cause the program
    -o OP              to ignore saved option screen settings).  You can
                       use this switch multiple times to run the game
                       with multiple operators.

                       Valid values for "OP" are:

                         add
                         subtract
                         multiply
                         divide

    --demo          -  Demo mode.  The game will cycle back and forth
    -d                 between the title and the game, and it will
                       auto-play the game.  The only user interaction
                       can be for quitting or pausing.


  These command-line options display useful information, but the program
  does not attempt to start up in interactive mode.

    --help          -  Display a short help message, explaining how to
    -h                 play the game.

    --usage         -  Display the available command-line options.
    -u

    --version       -  Display the version of "tuxmath" you're running.
    -v

    --copyright     -  Display copyright information
    -c

How To Play
-----------
  Destroying Comets
  -----------------
    As the comets fall towards your cities, you must solve their equations.

    To destroy it:
    --------------
      First, figure out the answer to the equation.
      For example, "3 x 4" would be "12"

      Second, type in the answer.  As you type numbers on the keyboard, they
      will appear in the "LED"-style display at the top center of the screen.

      Finally, press [ENTER / RETURN].


    The comet that has the number you entered as its answer will
    be shot down by Tux the penguin.

    Note: Sometimes more than one comet will have the same answer.
          In this case, the comet closest to your cities will be
          destroyed first.  [Perhaps all should be destroyed?]

    Note: After typing [ENTER / RETURN], the "LED"-style display will
          automatically reset to "000" for you, so you can answer the
          next equation!


  Correcting Your Answer
  ----------------------
    If you made a mistake as you typed in your answer, you can press
    [BACKSPACE / DELETE] and the "LED"-style display at the top center
    of the screen will reset to "000".


  Using the On-Screen Keypad
  --------------------------
    If you launched the program with the "--keypad" (or "-k") option,
    the game screen will also have an 11-key numeric keypad on the
    center of the screen.  (It has a similar layout to most keyboard
    number pads and calculators.)

    Using the mouse pointer to click on the on-screen buttons acts
    just like typing numbers on the keyboard.

    This feature could be useful for computers with touchscreens,
    or for players who cannot use a keyboard.


  Losing A City
  -------------
    If a comet crashes into one of your cities before you had the
    chance to answer its equation, the city's shields will be
    destroyed.  If the city is hit by another comet, it will be
    completely destroyed.

    Once you lose all of your cities, the game will end.

Setting Administrative Options
------------------------------
  "Tux, of Math Command" allows parents/teachers to adjust which parts
  of the game options can be changed by the player.

  For example, if you wish to, you can completely lock out all
  "Division" questions.  The students/children will still be able to enable
  and disable "Addition," "Subtraction," and "Multiplication" as they
  wish.

  On the other hand, you may wish to lock-in the other three kinds
  of equations, so that the players cannot disable any of them.
  All games will always have addition, subtraction and multiplication
  problems, but will never had division problems.
