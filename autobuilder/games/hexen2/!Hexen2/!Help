Hexen II: Hammer of Thyrion - Cross platform source port of the class based shooter game Hexen II
---------------------------

This game requires the original Hexen II datafiles. The demo version is available from http://www.fileplanet.com/10770/download/Hexen-II---Demo.
The exe file is just a zip file.
See http://www.steamprices.com/uk/sub/439/heretic-hexen-collection for the
full version.

Just extract the 'data1' folder and place it the !Hexen2 folder.

Hexen II uses the Quake I engine which makes extensive use of floating point so
the frame rate is quite low.
The '!Run' file defaults to fullscreeen 640 x 480 so should be ok on lesser machines.
At least a Beagleboard is recomended to get playable frame rates.
If sound is too fast/slow or stuttering try changing '-sndspeed 44100' in the
'!Run' file. Valid values are 11025, 22050 or 44100.
To alter the default resolution change the '-width' and '-height' options in
the !Run or to run in a window change '-f' to '-w'.

Here's the full list of valid options in the !Run file,

Usage: hexen2 [options]
     [-v | --version]        Display version information
     [-portals | -h2mp ]     Run the Portal of Praevus mission pack
     [-w | -window ]         Run the game windowed
     [-f | -fullscreen]      Run the game fullscreen
     [-width X [-height Y]]  Select screen size
     [-s | -nosound]         Run the game without sound
     [-nomouse]              Disable mouse usage
     [-listen N]             Enable multiplayer with max N players
     [-heapsize Bytes]       Heapsize (memory to allocate)

For Beagleboard and Pandaboard owners a VFP/NEON version exists. This gets
about 38fps @ 800 x 600 fullscreen on a Pandaboard ES @ 1500MHz as apposed to
19 fps for the default soft-float version.
By comparison on a Beagleboard Xm @ 1GHz about 24.2fps for VFP/NEON and
16.1fps for sof-float @ 640 x 480.
