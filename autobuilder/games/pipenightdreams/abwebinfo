Description: Connect pipes to get the water flowing from inlet to outlet.
 If you know the old arcade-game "Pipe Dreams", you'll instantly
 recognize this. The goal is to connect different pipe segments
 to let the water flow from the inlet and through as many pipes
 as possible, until it finally reaches the outlet. This requires
 an even combination of speed, skill and foresight.
