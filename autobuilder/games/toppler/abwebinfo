Description: Clone of the "Nebulus" game on old 8 and 16 bit machines.
 Toppler is an almost complete reimplementation of the old game known
 as Tower Toppler or Nebulus. 
 .
 The target of the game is to reach the target door of each of the 8
 towers in currently 2 missions with this little green animal. This
 door is usually at the very top of the tower. 
 .
 But finding the way by using elevators and walking through a maze
 of doors and platforms is not the only problem you have to solve.
 There are a bunch of other creatures living on the tower that will
 hinder you to reach your target by pushing you over the edge of the
 platforms.
