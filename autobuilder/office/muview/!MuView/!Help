The latest version is available from https://www.riscosports.co.uk

The !MuView application is just a simple front end onto the MuPDF 1.18.0 libraries.

See the MuPDF website at http://mupdf.com for more information.

Getting Started
---------------
Before running MuView ensure the RISC OS ROM you are using is from 18-Feb-18 onwards otherwise MuView will fail to run              causing an abort.
After double clicking the MuView application the MuView icon appears on the iconbar.

To display a file just drop the file onto the MuView iconbar icon. Valid file types are,
PDF
GIF
PNG
JPEG
BMP
TIFF
SVG
EPUB (A76)

The following file types don't currently exist on RISC OS so they will have to be set before
dropping the file onto the icon bar icon.
CBZ (AB1)
FB2 (AAF)
XPS (AB2)

Additionally PDF and EPUB files can be double-clicked to load.
To navigate a document press Page Up/Page Down.
To zoom in/out press the Up/Down cursor keys.
To roate clockwise/anti clockwise press the Right/Left cursor keys.
