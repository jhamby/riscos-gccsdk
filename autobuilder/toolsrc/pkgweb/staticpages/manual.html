<hr>

<p>The zip files on this site are created in a format suitable for the
 RISC OS Packaging project, however they are ordinary zip files and the
 application can be located inside them and dragged from them onto your
 RISC OS machine.</p>
<p>The application will normally be in a subfolder of the folder called Apps. (e.g. Apps.Games).</p>
<p>It is worth looking at the web pages here to see what else an application requires.</p>

<h3>Requirements</h3><p>The requirements for individual applications vary, but you generally need:<ul>
<li>SharedUnixLibrary module:<a href = "http://www.riscos.info/downloads/gccsdk/sharedunixlib/system.zip">http://www.riscos.info/downloads/gccsdk/sharedunixlib/system.zip</a></li>
<li>Some sound support requires the Digital Renderer module (shipped with the SharedUnixLibrary)</li>
<li>!UnixHome application (typically required by some ported Unix programs wishing to store configuration files and settings in the Unix user's home directory):<a href="http://www.riscos.info/unix/downloads/support/UnixHome-1.03.zip">http://www.riscos.info/unix/downloads/support/UnixHome-1.03.zip</a></li>
</ul></p>
