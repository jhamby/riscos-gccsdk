<h2>Autobuilt Applications and Libraries</h2><p>These pages contain applications and libraries that have been built with the GCCSDK autobuilder.</p>
<p>
For details of the autobuilder which is part of the GCCSDK for RISC OS please read <a href = "http://www.riscos.info/index.php/GCCSDK">here</a>
</p>
<p>
The recommended way to access the packages on these pages is using the package manager from the <a href="http://www.riscpkg.org">RISC OS Packaging Project</a>
</p>
<p>You will need to add this sites package index to the !RiscPkg sources file (Choices:RiscPkg.Sources) by adding the following line:<br>
pkg http://www.riscos.info/packages/pkg/autobuilt</p>

<p>You can browse this web site to see what is currently available or to directly download the packaged zip file to install them manually.<p>

<p><i>This site is currently under development, so pages and file locations may change</i></p>
<p>Please use for following links, for more information:
<ul>
<li><a href="riscpkg.html">Information on the packages on this site.</a>
<li><a href="manual.html">Instruction on manually installing the packages.</a>
<li><a href="stats.html">Statistics on the last build of this site</a>
</ul>

<h3>Finding a package</h3>
<p>An application or library can be easily found using one of the following:
<ul>
<li><a href = "ABCIndex.html">Alphabetical Index</a></li>
<li><a href = "SectionIndex.html">Section/Category Index</a></li>
</ul>
</p>

<h3>Source code</h3>
<p>
Many of the packages on this site are released under licences that require the source
code to be provided. The source code for these packages can be downloaded from the
subdirectories of <a href="src">http://www.riscos.info/packages/src</a>
</p>

<h3>Last version of this site</h3>
<p>During the changeover period from the old version of this site to the new version based on the RISC OS packaging project the old downloads and indices are still available</p>
<ul>
<li><a href = "AlphaIndex.html">Alphabetical Index</a></li>
<li><a href = "CatIndex.html">Category Index</a></li>
</ul></p>
<p><i>Warning: The old site and pages will be removed when the new site contains all the packages from it.</i></p>


<h3>Warning</h3><p>The applications and libraries provided on these pages are intended to be rebuilt by the autobuilder regularly. This means that it is possible that they may not run if a change in upstream sources or the GCCSDK compiler introduces a bug.</p>
