<h2>Autobuilt Applications and Libraries</h2><p>These pages contain applications and libraries that have been built with the <a href= "http://www.riscos.info/index.php/GCCSDK">GCCSDK autobuilder</a>.</p>
<p>
The recommended way to access the packages on these pages is using the package manager from the <a href="http://www.riscpkg.org">RISC OS Packaging Project</a>
</p>
<p>You will need to add this sites package index to the !RiscPkg sources file (Choices:RiscPkg.Sources) by adding the following line:<br>

<pre>
  pkg http://www.riscos.info/packages/pkg/autobuilt
</pre>

<p>You can browse the indexes to see what is currently available or to directly download the packaged zip file to install manually.<p>


<h3>Finding a package</h3>
<p>An application or library can be easily found using one of the following:
<ul>
<li><a href = "ABCIndex.html">Alphabetical Index</a></li>
<li><a href = "SectionIndex.html">Section/Category Index</a></li>
</ul>
</p>

<h3>Source code</h3>
<p>
Many of the packages on this site are released under licences that require the source
code to be provided. Source code for these packages can be downloaded from <a href="http://www.riscos.info/packages/src/">http://www.riscos.info/packages/src/</a>
</p>

<h3>Further Information</h3>

<li><a href="manual.html">Instruction on manually installing the packages.</a>
<li><a href="stats.html">Statistics on the last build of this site</a>
</ul>

<h3>Warning</h3><p>The applications and libraries provided on these pages are intended to be rebuilt by the autobuilder regularly. This means that it is possible that they may not run if a change in upstream sources or the GCCSDK compiler introduces a bug.</p>
