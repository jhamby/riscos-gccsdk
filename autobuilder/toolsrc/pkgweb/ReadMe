pkgweb
------

The pkgweb program creates web pages with details of the packages found in an index file for the RISC OS Packaging project.

Usage:

pkgweb <packages_file> <dest_dir> <url_base>

<packages_file> it the index file to process.
<dest_dir> is the directory to create the web pages in.
<url_base> is the relative location of the index web pages from the <packages_file>.

e.g.
pkgweb unstable test ..

will create the web pages from the unstable index into a directory called test. The download url will all be updated so that the first component of the path will be removed.
