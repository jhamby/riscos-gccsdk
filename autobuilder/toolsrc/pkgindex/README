pkgindex
--------

The pkgindex makes the index file for packages contained within directory and all its descendants.

To invoke it run.

pkgindex <dir_to_index> <index_file> [-u <base_url>]

<dir_to_index> is the directory containing the packages.
<index_file> is the name of the index file.
<base_url> is the prefix for the URL entry in the index file that gives the
relative location of the packages to the location of the index file.
e.g. if the index_file is put in a folder called "pkg" and the packages are
placed in a folder called "binary" in the same directory as "pkg" the
base_url would be "../binary/".
