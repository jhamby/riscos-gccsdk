This directory contains the source for C++ programs used to
build the autobuilder website.

The build-website script in the autobuilder directory uses
them both to create the full website.

The programs are:

pkgindex - build the RISC OS Packaging Project index
pkgweb   - create a HTML website based on the above index file

These programs also use a cut down version of the libpkg
library (home page can be found on www.riscpkg.org) that
just includes the minimum files these programs require.
