LibPkg

Version 0.2.1 (25 Feb 2005)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Introduction

  LibPkg is a package management library for RISC OS. It includes
  classes to:
    * represent version numbers, status records and control files;
    * access the content of package files; and
    * install and remove packages.

  The first use of LibPkg will be as the back-end of RiscPkg, but it is
  not tied to any particular user interface and there could be other
  front-ends in the future. Parts of LibPkg are likely to be useful for
  writing package development tools and other types of package
  management utility.

WARNING

  LibPkg is currently at an early stage of development and it has not
  yet received extensive testing. Package managers by their nature have
  the potential to do serious harm to your filesystem. At this time it
  would be unwise to use LibPkg on a system you do not consider to be
  expendable.

  (If LibPkg does go wrong then it is most likely to corrupt software
  that it itself has installed, closely followed by the contents of the
  !Boot directory. It is much less likely to touch user data, however
  now would be a good time to review your backup policy.)

Requirements

  Supported operating systems include:
    * RISC OS 4.02
    * RISC OS 5.03

  Supported compilers include:
    * GCC 2.95.4 (release 3)
    * GCC 2.95.4 (experimental 32-bit, 05 May 2003)

  The Acorn C/C++ compiler (up to version 3.19 at least) is not
  supported because there are important parts of the C++ language that
  it does not implement.

Installation

  The !LibPkg application directory can be located anywhere.

  Ensure that it has been booted and/or run before attempting to compile
  or link against it.

  (If two or more versions are present, running !LibPkg will change the
  active version whereas booting it will not.)

Use

  When compiling, append -Ilibpkg: to the GCC command line. This adds
  libpkg: to the list of paths that are searched for include files.

  When linking, append -llibpkg:a.libpkg to the GCC command line. This
  adds libpkg:a.libpkg to the list of libraries searched by the linker.

  Include directives should be of the form:

    #include "libpkg/control.h"

  Be aware that all LibPkg classes are declared within the namespace
  pkg. You must either specify the namespace expicitly:

    pkg::control

  or place a using directive at the start of each source file:

    using namespace control;

  Documentation available from the RiscPkg web site currently includes:
    * the LibPkg reference manual

Building from Source

  To build LibPkg from souce code the following tools must be present on
  the Run$Path:
    * make
    * gcc
    * libfile
    * fixdeps

  Also required are the libraries:
    * zlib
    * libcurl
    * RTK

  Suitable versions of make, gcc and libfile may be found within
  supported distributions of GCC. fixdeps and the RTK may be obtained
  from the RTK web site (http://www.sagitta.demon.co.uk/rtk/).

  No configuration is necessary. Change the current directory to !LibPkg
  then issue the command:

    make all

  Please note that some difficulties have been encountered when using
  recursive makefiles with the experimental 32-bit version of make. They
  can be overcome by executing the makefiles individually from an obey
  file.
