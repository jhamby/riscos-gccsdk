It was ported to demonstrated the use of sound support in Unixlib, which
emulates the /dev/dsp OSS system found on Linux.


Installation
------------

madplay can be placed anywhere, but putting it in your Run$Path such as
in the !Boot Library directory will make it easily accessable.

Normally you run madplay in a taskwindow:

Add the -v flag for more info whilst playing, note that there are key
controls for volume and pausing.
