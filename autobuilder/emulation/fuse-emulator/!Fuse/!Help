Fuse - the Free Unix Spectrum Emulator (v1.0.0.1)

This RISC OS version was created by the GCCSDK Autobuilder

See the "doc" subdirectory for more documentation or the official fuse
website at http://fuse-emulator.sourceforge.net/

Getting Started
---------------

I've set up the !Run file with some sensible defaults. 

Run <Fuse$Dir>.fuse -g 2x --sound --speed 100 --machine 48 --tape %*0 ><Fuse$Dir>.stdout 2><Fuse$Dir>.stderr

These are 2x scaling of the screen, sound is on, speed is throttled to 100%, machine
it set to emulate a 48K spectrum and loading of 'tzx' tape files. I've set up the arbirary 
filetype of &BA0 - "Z80Em". So if you set the filetype to "Z80Em" of any roms you have
they should automatically load !Fuse and run the rom when double-clicked on.

Alternatively press 'F1' in fuse to access the built-in UI.

History
-------
RISC OS Version 1.00 (28-Mar-12)
- this is the initial version of fuse built for RISC OS.

Issues
------

There's no RISC OS integration. Fuse uses it's own UI. Press 'F1' to bring up the
menu. You can also set default options in the !Run file.

I've only tested running a few games. Many of the emulator features are untested.
