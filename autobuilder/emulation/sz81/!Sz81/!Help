sz81 - Sinclair ZX80/ZX81 emulator (v2.1.7)

This RISC OS version was created by the GCCSDK Autobuilder

See the "doc" subdirectory for more documentation or the official sz81
website at http://sz81.sourceforge.net/

Getting Started
---------------

Click in the window or press 'F1' in fuse to access the built-in UI.

History
-------
RISC OS Version 1.00 (16-Oct-15)
- this is the initial version of fuse built for RISC OS.

Issues
------

There's no RISC OS integration. Sz81 uses it's own UI. Press 'F1' to bring up the menu.

Not done much testing so there could be bugs/misfeatures.
