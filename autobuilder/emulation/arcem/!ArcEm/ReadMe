Known Problems
==============

Mouse movement only works if 'mouse following' is turned on. This
is toggled on/off by pressing the F4 key.

Due to resource requirements it will only run on RISC OS 5 capable
hardware. This includes the Iyonix and Beagleboard based hardware.

Screen update is very slow. Don't expect playable framerates in games.

Shift clicks are ignored.

The screen is shifted over to the left a bit.
