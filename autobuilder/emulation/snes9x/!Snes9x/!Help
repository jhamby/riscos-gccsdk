Snes9x - Super Nintendo Entertainment System (SNES) Emulator (v1.53)

This RISC OS version was created by the GCCSDK Autobuilder

See the "docs" subdirectory for more documentation or the official Snes9x
website at http://www.snes9x.com/

Getting Started
---------------

I've set up a filetype 'snesrom', &a8c. All you need to do is set the file
type of the rom you want to run to 'snesrom'. The !Snes9x folder must first
be 'seen' by the filer otherwise you'll get an error. Now double-click on
the rom and if all goes well a window should open on the desktop.

To change various settings for Snes9x edit the file in !Snes9x.snes9x/conf.


History
-------
RISC OS Version 1.00 (11-Apr-12)
- this is the initial version of Snes9x built for RISC OS.

Issues
------
It's slow. You'll need at least Beagleboard based hardware to get snes9x
running anywhere near full speed. If you find the sound
stutters it probably means your machine isn't fast enough. Disabling sound
will speed things up if you don't mind playing in silence.

For armv7 based machines there seems to be an issue when alignment execptions
is turned on. If nothing happens when you double-click a rom turn off alignment
exceptions and try again.
