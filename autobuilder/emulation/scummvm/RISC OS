RISC OS port by Peter Naulls

19th March 2011

This port is part of the GCCSDK riscos.info autobuilder.  The
ScummVM for RISC OS page is:

  http://www.riscos.info/index.php/ScummVM

This is version 1.2.1, and updates my 2004 version 0.8 and 2009 1.0.0 RC1, 1.0.0 ports

RISC OS Notes:

ScummVM should run ok and be usable on a RiscPC, although it can be
a touch slow.  I recommend you turn down screen scaling and run in
full screen mode.  You might like to investigate the "fast modes"
in games (e.g. ctrl-f).

To use games from the ScummVM site (see the extras section on 
http://scummvm.sourceforge.net/downloads.php), I suggest you unzip them to a directory
at the same level as !ScummVM, change CSD to that directory and run
and select the directory from within ScummVM.  Once a game is configured,
it will remember the path in future.


Known Issues:

Flight of the Amazon Queen and Beneath a Steel Sky are the only
games thoroughly tested with the RISC OS version and work fine.
Simon the Sorceror also seems to work ok.
