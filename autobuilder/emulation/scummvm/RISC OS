RISC OS port by Peter Naulls

24th December 2004

This program was ported as part of the Unix Porting Project, for its
Xmas 2004 games porting promotion. See the following URL for more
details: http://www.drobe.co.uk/riscos/artifact1242.html

Support is only available to subscribers to the Unix Porting Project.

RISC OS Notes:

ScummVM should run ok and be usable on a RiscPC, although it can be
a touch slow.  I recommend you turn down screen scaling and run in
full screen mode.  You might like to investigate the "fast modes"
in games (e.g. ctrl-f).

To use games from the ScummVM site (see the extras section on http://scummvm.sourceforge.net/downloads.php), I suggest you unzip them to a directory
at the same level as !ScummVM, change CSD to that directory and run
and select the directory from within ScummVM.  Once a game is configured,
it will remember the path in future.

There will hopefully be speed improvements in future.

The game files are large, and are available on the Unix Porting Project
CD if you don't wish to download them.


Known Issues:

Flight of the Amazon Queen and Beneath a Steel Sky are the only
games throughly tested with the RISC OS version and work fine.  I have not
been able to get the DOS version of Simon the Sorcerer to work, although
it works ok in other versions.
