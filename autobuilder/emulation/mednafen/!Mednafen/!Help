Mednafen - Multi-system Emulator (v0.8.D)

This RISC OS version was created by the GCCSDK Autobuilder

See the "documentation" subdirectory for more documentation or the official Mednafen
website at http://mednafen.sourceforge.net/

Getting Started
---------------

I've set up a filetype 'mednafen', &a8a. All you need to do is set the file type of the
rom you want to run to 'mednafen'. The !Mednafen folder must first be 'seen' by the filer
otherwise you'll get an error.
You'll also need to make sure the filename ends with one of the following depending on the type
of rom.

/nes
/fds
/nsf
/nsfe
/unf
/unif
/nez
/gb
/gbc
/gba
/agb
/cgb
/bin
/pce
/hes
/sgx
/ngp
/ngc
/ws
/wsc

These would be the file extensions on other platforms. Now double-click on the rom and if all
goes well a window should open on the desktop.

History
-------
RISC OS Version 1.00 (05-Apr-12)
- this is the initial version of Mednafen built for RISC OS.

Issues
------

It's slow. You'll need at least Beagleboard based hardware to get most of the emulations
running anywhere near full speed. If you find the sound stutters it probably means your
machine isn't fast enough. Disabling sound will speed things up if you don't mind playing
in silence.

There's no RISC OS integration. There is a configuration file automatically generated
when Mednafen is run for the first time. See !UnixHome.home./mednafen.mednafen/cfg.

I've only tested running a few games on the various emulators. I've not yet been able to
test pc-fx emulation.
