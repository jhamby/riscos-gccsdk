RetroArch - Frontend for emulators, game engines and media players (v1.8.1)

This RISC OS version was created by the GCCSDK Autobuilder

For documentation see the official RetroArch website athttps://https://docs.libretro.com//

Getting Started
---------------

Just double-click the !RetroArch application. After a few seconds a window should open showing the menu system.


History
-------
RISC OS Version 0.01 (14-Mar-20)
- this is the initial test version of RetroArch v1.8.1 built for RISC OS.

Issues
------

Some cores run too slowly to be playable. If the frame rate drop below the core framerate
the sound badly stutters or slows down.

The command line options have no effect.

There's no RISC OS integration. There is a configuration file automatically generated
when RetroArch is run for the first time. See !UnixHome.home./config.retroarch.RetroArch/cfg.

I've only tested running a few games on the various cores. Some cores may need alignment exceptions
turning off.
