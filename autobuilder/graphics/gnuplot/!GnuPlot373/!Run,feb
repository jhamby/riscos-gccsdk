| Check the presence of suitable viewers,
| usually Draw and Paint
If "<Alias$@RunType_AFF>" = "" Then Error Draw or another drawfile viewer has not been seen.
If "<Alias$@RunType_FF9>" = "" Then Error Paint or another sprite file viewer has not been seen.

| Ensure modules.
| This version was compiled with gcc 3.4.4 or higher and UnixLib,
| so it needs CallASWI and the fpe and the shared unix lib.
| (UnixLib is located automagically by the program, but it is neater
| to check here anyway.)

| Launch the program in its own task window.
| The 32 bits version is /very/ memory hungry!
| So enable dynamic areas.
