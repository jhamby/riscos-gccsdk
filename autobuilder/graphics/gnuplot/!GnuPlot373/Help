Description:  `gnuplot` is a command-driven interactive function and data plotting program.
 It is case sensitive (commands and function names written in lowercase are
 not the same as those written in CAPS).  All command names may be abbreviated
 as long as the abbreviation is not ambiguous.  Any number of commands may
 appear on a line (with the exception that `load` or `call` must be the final
 command), separated by semicolons (;).  Strings are indicated with quotes.
 They may be either single or double quotation marks, e.g.,

       load "filename"
       cd 'dir'

 This version is based on release 3.7.3 and includes the extentions for 
 RISC OS by B.A. Brand (taken from release 3.7.1).
