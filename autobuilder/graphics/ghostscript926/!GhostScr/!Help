GPL Ghostscript 9.26 (06-Jun-20)

This RISC OS version was created by the GCCSDK Autobuilder

See the "9_26.doc" subdirectory for more documentation or the official ghostscript website at http://www.ghostscript.com

Getting Started
---------------
This is the latest version built by the GCCSDK Autobuilder. See the oldHelp file
for information on previous versions and installation instructions.
This version uses more memory then previous versions so RISC OS 5.2x is recommended. If you don't
require any of the new features the older version is still available from
http://www.riscos.info/packages/arm/Graphics/ghostscript_8.71-2.zip.
