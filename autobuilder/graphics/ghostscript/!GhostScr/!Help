GPL Ghostscript 8.71 (04-Apr-17)

This RISC OS version was created by the GCCSDK Autobuilder

See the "8_71.doc" subdirectory for more documentation or the official ghostscript website at http://www.ghostscript.com

Getting Started
---------------
This is the first version built by the GCCSDK Autobuilder. See the oldHelp file
for information on previous versions and installation instructions.
This version now runs correctly on modern RISC OS platforms. Previous versions
may display colours incorrectly on ARMv7 or fail to run completely on ARMv8. (Notably the Raspberry Pi 3).
