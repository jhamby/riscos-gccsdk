Automated backdrop changer for JPEGs and Sprites.
Written for RISC OS 3.1 or higher (with SpriteExtend 0.99 and above),
although may work on RISC OS 3.1 with SpriteExtend and Dynamic Area support

Décor is a small TSR program I saw on the Macintosh which allows you to
change the "desktop pattern" or backdrop after a certain amount of time.
I decided to write a version for RISC OS for fun.

Well, it's a backdrop changer for which is able to alter the RISC OS desktop
backdrop after a predetermined amount of time. You can also change the
backdrop manually if you get sick of the one that is already being displayed.
The advantage of this backdrop changer of others I have seen is that it is
able to directly process JPEG files, and so the lovely new backdrops you have
downloaded from the Internet don't have to be converted into sprites. Also,
it can re-plot the JPEG file upon mode changes so the grotty 256 colour mode
which did your picture no justice can be shown in up to 16 million colours
without you having to do anything!

How to use
~~~~~~~~~~
When you first run Décor, it will probably report than it needs to
be configured.  To do this, Adjust click on the icon bar icon, and then
choose "Backdrops...", then drag your favourite directories of JPEG
and Sprite image files to the writable icons.  The C, T and S radio
buttons refer to the pinboard Centre, Tile and Scale options for that
directory of pictures.  Click Ok, then Save, now click on the icon
bar icon with Select.

Menu items
~~~~~~~~~~
Info        - provides information about !Décor.
Setup       - allows you to customise various settings for !Décor.
Save Setup  - saves the current settings to the configuration file.
Remove Icon - removes the icon from the icon bar. Once this is done, you
              cannot get it back without restarting the program.
Quit        - exits the program.

The Setup Window
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
In the Décor Controls section there is:

"Delete backdrop file upon quitting"
This option, when set will delete the Backdrops file inside the Décor
directory when you quit it. This can save some disc space if you are tight
on it, but can also cause problems, like backdrops disappearing after mode
changes, or after returning from a session on the command line. Converted
JPEG backdrops in 16 million colours can be bigger than 2 MB in size.

"Auto quit after displaying backdrop"
Décor will display only one of the backdrops, and then quit.

"Let Pinboard handle JPEGs"
Under RISC OS 4, and with certain OS extension programs, you choose this option and the pinboard will replot the JPEG in real-time on the backdrop when it needs to redraw itself.  Of course, this can be a little slow but it
will save you a fair amount of memory, as the whole decompressed image
doesn't have to be held in memory.  It is suggested that you don't use
this option in 256-colour modes, as the dithering isn't too hot.  If you select this option, then the following two options become unselectable.

"Re-plot JPEG files on mode change"
This option, when set will re-process the current backdrop after any mode
change if it is a JPEG file so the maximum picture quality is kept. However,
it does introduce a bit of extra time, and if you don't have a StrongARM, you
may have to put up with a few seconds wait with this option on.

"Fast JPEG dithering (lower quality)"
Enables or disables fast dithering of JPEG pictures. Faster dithering means
lower quality pictures. Slow dithering takes about twice the time of fast
dithering. Sprite files are not dithered by this program.

"Automatically change backdrop" and "Time between changes"
This selects whether you wish !Décor to automatically change backdrops after
a time specified by the "Time between changes" box, which can be edited.

"Display on icon bar"
If you choose this option, then the program will be removed from the
icon bar immediately, and not be placed there when you subsequently
run it.  If you wish to override this (to reconfigure the program),
then press the ALT key, when you double-click and run the application.

"Sequential after First"
The first file chosen will be random, but from then it'll choose files
in sequence from there.  You can turn this on at any time, and have it
continue in sequence from the last file it chose.

The Backdrop Controls section details how the backdrop is to be plotted on
the Pinboard
"Centered" - the picture is placed in the middle of the screen.
"Tiled"    - the picture is repeated across and up and down the screen.
"Scaled"   - the picture is 'stretched' to fit the screen.

Choose your options, and click OK to set them.

Note that while only 12 directories are displayed here, if you
really need more, you can edit the configuration file.  Just make
sure the number before the list of directories corresponds to the
number of entries.

Other Stuff
~~~~~~~~~~~

The menu options "Centred", "Scaled" and "Tiled" will cause the backdrop to
be replotted with the chosen option.

You can drag a JPEG or Sprite to the Décor icon on the icon bar - this
will cause to be immediately displayed.  This will be displayed with the
current menu option.

If you drag a directory to the icon bar, then the list of backdrops will be
forgotten about until it gets relogged (by rerunning, or pressing "Ok"
in the backdrop directories list), and any images in this directory
will be used in the meantime.  Again, these will use the current option
from the menu.

If you grow tired of the temporary one, the menu option "Forget temp dir"
option in the menu can be used, and Décor will revert to the original
pictures.

Shift-Select on the icon bar during sequential mode will cause the
previous picture to be chosen, rather than the next.



List of features added by Peter and bug fixes for version 1.20

- Separate Pathname dialogue box added to allow up to different directories
  to be added.
- Adjust-Click on icon bar opens options window.
- Random number generator seeded so we don't get the same sequence at
  start up.
- Changing the backdrop by clicking on the icon bar did not reset the clock.
- Backdrop removed for delete option, so as not to cause an error when
  redrawn by the desktop later on.
- Rouge icon in Templates removed.
- Stopped Décor failing if it could not find specified paths, or if
  files in a directory were not JPEGs or Sprites.
- You can actually press either ALT key at start up.
- Made sure directories were relogged when paths are changed.
- Stopped Décor hanging if there was only one picture in a directory
- Adjust in menu now keeps menu open.
- Note it is possible to use the Megaboard placement options when using
  megaboard by manually editing the configuration file.  e.g. "Top" aligns the
  backdrop with the top of the screen.

1.30 (Peter)

- Minor fixes and changes, most notable, changing of reading of bpp
  on mode changes.

1.40 (Peter)

- Added in dragging of directories to the configuration writable icons.
- Updated outdated !Help.

2.00 (Peter)

- RISC User version 2, including suggestions by Richard Hallas
- Complete rewrite in C, using the DeskLib library.  I intend to move
  this to the the newer 'Desk' library when I get a chance, but this is
  fine for now.
- Changed the grabbing of the large chunk of memory for sprite creation
  from adjusting the WimpSlot to a Dynamic area, since this can be nasty
  in C.
- Fixed a bug whereby you would have have to press "Ok" and then "Save"
  for the settings to be saved properly.
- Extended directory list to 12 entries (you can add extra entries in
  the config, but won't be displayed).
- Added dragging sprites, JPEGs and directories to the icon bar.
- Added menu options for changing the display option of the current backdrop.

- Removed Save setup from menu.
- More style guide stuff.
- Changed icon bar priority.
- Added shift-click option
- Misc other bug fixes.

4.00

- Blatant version jump.
- Allow pinboard to replot JPEGs in real-time.

  (This idea from David Watson)
