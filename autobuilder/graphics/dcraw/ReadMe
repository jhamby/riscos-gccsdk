ReadMe for dcraw
================

This is a quick (and untested) compilation of dcraw for RISC OS. 
The original sources may be found here:

  http://www.cybercom.net/~dcoffin/dcraw/

See the above site for help and other information. Simply running dcraw 
with no arguments should provide some basic usage information.

For those wishing to rebuild it, it is included in the GCCSDK autobuilder.

I have no intention of providing any further support for this (especially as
I have no digital camera to test it with).
