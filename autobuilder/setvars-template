# Template for setvars file for autobuilder package
#
# The file can set a number of variables, all of which have defaults
# to perform various actions during the build.  Copy this file to
# a new package directory and delete uneeded parts.


# Files to be zipped into the package with their complete path
AB_FILESPATH=

# Files to be zipped into the package at the top level without paths
AB_FILESNOPATH=

# Man page file, to be processed by rman to make an HTML helpfile
# Updated so this can now be a list of files
AB_MANPAGE=

# RISC OS Version of the package
AB_ROVERSION=1

# Commands to be carried out prior to zip, such as copying or moving files
AB_PREZIP=

# Command in front of invokation of RISC OS GNU configure wrapper.  If you do
# not want this to be called, you could see this var to ":"
AB_PRECONF=

# Flags to pass to configure in addition to those added by the configure
# wrapper.
AB_CONFLAGS=

# Continue on, even if the program or library fails to fully compile
# (e.g. example/test apps)
AB_COMPILEFAIL=no

# Run "make install" after build
AB_INSTALL=no

# RISC OS configuration script
AB_CONFIG=$AB_GCCENV/ro-config

# RISC OS make wrapper.  This can be set to just "make" if setting the
# path causes problems - e.g., the native compiler is required too
AB_MAKE=$AB_GCCENV/ro-make

# Zip name; alternate name for package to be zipped as
# Useful if tools from a library, etc.
AB_ZIPNAME=

# Name ReadMe should be zipped as.  For example, !Program/!Help,fff
# Don't forget to escape '!' in bash.
AB_README=ReadMe,fff

# Finally, as this file is executed as a bash script, you can place other
# commands in here.  These will be executed after unpack of the source
# and application of any patches, but before any configuration or build.
