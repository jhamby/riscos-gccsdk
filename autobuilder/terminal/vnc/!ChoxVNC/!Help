About
-----

This is a (mostly) unmodified port of the Unix VNC viewer.

This client allows you use desktops on other machines running VNC
servers including Windows, Linux and other RISC OS machines.

The lack of modification to the sources is allowed by the
X replacement library for RISC OS, ChoX11.  More information on this
is on its homepage: http://www.riscos.info/index.php/ChoX11

Although there are 'native' RISC OS VNC clients, this port was done
to test ChoX11, and may or may not be preferrable to clients such
as !ViNCe.

Usage
-----

Running !ChoxVNC will launch a FrontEnd dialogue, into which you can enter
the hostname.  If using the connect button fails to open a window, examine
the 'stderr' file inside the !ChoxVNC application.
