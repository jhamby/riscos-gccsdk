Before you start
----------------

Please obtain Nettle from:

    http://nettle.sourceforge.net/

And !UnixHome from

    http://www.chocky.org/unix/


Installing
----------

Place the ncftp2 binary anywhere you like - somewhere in the Run$Path
may be sensible.  ncftp2 makes use of the !UnixHome application to store
files, this will need to be seen by the filer beforehand.


Usage
-----

ncftp2 is designed to work running as an "ANSI Task" under Nettle. Its use
running outside of Nettle is limited.

ncftp2 is started by typing "ncftp" it into the command dialogue of Nettle as
an ANSI task, with an optional site name as a parameter.
