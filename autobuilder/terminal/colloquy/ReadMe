Introduction
------------

Colloquy is a powerful talker server, allowing users to connect to it and waste lots of time chatting in real time to one another on it.

This RISC OS version was ported by Peter Naulls.  Testing, RISC OS icon, and RISCOS specific help writen by Chris Williams.

Starting the talker
-------------------

Firstly, the talker server must be configured; open the !Colloquy application and then inside the dist-riscos-arm directory you should find a config.lua file. Open this with a standard text editor and follow the instructions in the file to set up the talker.

To start the server, double click on the !Colloquy filer icon to launch the talker. Two taskwindow processes are started, a resolver component and the main talker server which listens on the configured port for telnet based connections.

To log into the talker, point your favourite telnet client at the IP of the machine running the server along with the configured port and then follow the instructions to connect. You should initially log in as the priviledged user 'god' (with password also 'god') and then setup the talker and user accounts accordingly.  Then change the god password.

Using the talker
----------------

Once logged in, whatever you type will be seen by other users in their terminals. Commands to the talker (which cannot be read by other users), are issued with a . preceeding them, .help explains a few basic commands.

Shutting down the talker
------------------------

In order to safely close down the talker, as god or a suitably priviledged user, use the .closedown command.  You can also close the TaskWindow, but this may note be the most friendly to connected users.
