Please note
-----------

Part of the Unix Porting Project.  Support for this program under RISC OS
is only offered to subscribers.  See http://www.chocky.org/unix/
for more information.


About
-----

This is a (mostly) unmodified port of the Linux RDesktop client,
seen at http://www.rdesktop.org/

This client allows you to log onto Windows NT Terminal Server sessions,
provided by various versions of Windows, including Windows 2000 Server
and WindowsXP.   

The lack of modification to the sources is allowed by the
X replacement library for RISC OS, ChoX11.  More information on this
is on its homepage: http://www.riscos.info/xlib/


Usage
-----

Running !RDesktop will launch a FrontEnd dialogue, into which you can enter
the hostname, and username if you wish - these can also be saved.  If
using the connect button fails to open a window, examine the 'stderr' file
inside the !RDesktop application.


Changes
-------

3rd December - Now much faster than the original release
