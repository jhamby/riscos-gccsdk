About
-----

This is a port of the ssh client from OpenSSH.  It supports ssh1 and
ssh2 protcols.  Hopefully in future, there will also be working scp
and sftp clients.


Before you start
----------------

Please obtain Nettle from:

    http://nettle.sourceforge.net/

And !UnixHome from

    http://www.chocky.org/unix/


Installing
----------

Place the ssh binary anywhere you like - somewhere in the Run$Path
may be sensible.


Usage
-----

ssh is designed to work running as an "ANSI Task" under Nettle. Its use
running outside of Nettle is limited.

ssh also requires a large wimpslot - greater than about 1.1MB before it will
start.

ssh is started by typing "ssh user@host " into the command dialogue of Nettle
as an ANSI task.  Other options are possible.

There are ongoing issues with escape handling in Unixlib, which happen to
afflict ssh.  Input sequences which use escape (e.g. arrow keys) do not
work (but unlike previous versions they won't cause it to exit).  And
after initial log in, CR/LR is broken.  Type "reset" under unix to fix this.
Please do not report this issues.  I thought it better to release this version
as is, to provide some usefulness.

Also unlike previous versions, it should not lock the machine if the
taskwindow is closed before the program exits.


History

Release 1 - Initial Public version.
