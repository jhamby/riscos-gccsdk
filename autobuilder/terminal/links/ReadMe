Before you start
----------------

Please obtain Nettle from:

    http://nettle.sourceforge.net/

And !UnixHome from

    http://www.chocky.org/unix/


Installing
----------

Place the Links binary anywhere you like - somewhere in the Run$Path
may be sensible.


Usage
-----

Links is designed to work running as an "ANSI Task" under Nettle. Its use
running outside of Nettle is limited.

Links also requires a large wimpslot - greater than about 1.4MB before it will
start.

Links is started by typing "links" into the command dialogue of Nettle as an ANSI task, with an optional URL as a parameter.

If you do no specify a URL, it will start with a blank screen.  Press 'G'
to enter a URL.


Colour
------

The default setup in links is for black and white.  To get colour
access the menu bar (escape or mouse click on top line), then Setup
menu -> Terminal Options -> Click Color -> Ok.
