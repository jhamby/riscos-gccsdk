Installing
----------

Place the BitchX binary anywhere you like - somewhere in the Run$Path
may be sensible.  You can set BitchX's default variables by editing
!UnixHome.home.!HomeRC appropriately, and rerunning !UnixHome.



Running
-------

BitchX is designed to work running as an "ANSI Task" under Nettle. Its use
running outside of Nettle is limited.

BitchX also requires a large wimpslot - greater than about 1.4MB before it will
start.

BitchX is started by typing "BitchX <user> <server>" into the command dialogue
of Nettle as an ANSI task.  You do not have to specify the paramaters if you've
put defaults in !HomeRC.

Have fun.
