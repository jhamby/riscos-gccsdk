Before you start
----------------

Please obtain Nettle from:

    http://nettle.sourceforge.net/


Installing
----------

Place the Nano binary anywhere you like - somewhere in the Run$Path may be sensible.


Usage
-----

Nano is designed to work running as an "ANSI Task" under Nettle. Its use
running outside of Nettle is limited.

Nano is started by typing it into the command dialogue of Nettle as an ANSI
task, with an optional filename as a parameter.
