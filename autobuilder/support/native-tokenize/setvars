# Steve Fryatt's BBC BASIC tokeniser
# from http://www.stevefryatt.org.uk/software/build/
# a native copy is built to aid in managing BASIC programs in version
# control systems and release management

# note spelling of 'tokenise' and 'tokenize' is somewhat haphazard.  The
# author's webpage refers to it as 'tokenize' so that is what is used.
