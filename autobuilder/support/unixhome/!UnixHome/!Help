!UnixHome 1.03
==============

This is a helper application to provide a place to store preference files, and
set variables required for Unix ports in RISC OS.


Why?
----

Typically, if you don't have variables like HOME set, you will get files dumped
by Unix ports in either the top level of your directory tree, or your CSD -
often not the most handy place.

In addition, some Unix applications require variables to be set before they
will run properly, or to set alternative paths for configuration files would
which otherwise be in inconvenient places in RISC OS (e.g. /etc).


Installation
------------

Copy the application to somewhere where it will be seen by the filer before you
run any Unix apps which will use it.  Double-clicking will open the "Home"
directory, where files will be stored.  This also contains an Obey file
"!HomeRC".  You may customise this if you like, but it is suggested you follow
the instructions in this file and make your own.
