| User specfic variables for RISC OS Unix ports

| This file is distributed with !UnixHome, so may be overwritten if
| you upgrade !UnixHome.  It is suggest therefore that you make your
| own file "!UserRC" if you want to customise anything.  This is called
| from the last line of this file.

| Set the variables.  The home location is in UnixEnv$HOME, and you
| can set values relative to this, although you should use '/' as a
| directory seperator.  You can set values with the "UnixEnv$" prefix,
| or plain, as you would see them in Unix.


| Default Terminal type for Curses applications
Set UnixEnv$TERM xterm-vt220

| Lynx needs a path to look for its home
Set UnixEnv$LYNX_CFG <UnixEnv$HOME>/lynx.cfg

| Call User's custom settings
IfThere <Obey$Dir>.!UserRC Then <Obey$Dir>.!UserRC
