About
-----

Dillo is a simple Unix browser; it's not particularly capable, but can
be nice in some instances.


Installation
------------

Copy the !UnixHome skeleton over your existing !UnixHome application to
provide a configuration file for Dillo.   Place !Dillo in your location
of choice.


Usage
-----

Dillo simply runs as a normal RISC OS application, and makes use of the ChoX11
library to translation X Window System calls into RISC OS Wimp calls.
