Before you start
----------------

Please obtain Nettle from:

    http://nettle.sourceforge.net/

And !UnixHome from

    http://www.riscos.info/packages/


Installing
----------

Place the Lynx binary anywhere you like - somewhere in the Run$Path
may be sensible.   Lynx's config file is in a dummy !UnixHome
application.  Place this over the top of the real !UnixHome application.


Usage
-----

Lynx is designed to work running as an "ANSI Task" under Nettle. Its use
running outside of Nettle is limited.

Lynx also requires a large wimpslot - greater than about 1.4MB before it will
start.

Lynx is started by typing "lynx" into the command dialogue of Nettle as an ANSI
task, with an optional URL as a parameter.
