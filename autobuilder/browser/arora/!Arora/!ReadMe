                    Arora Web Browser - RISC OS port


Windows can be resized by shift select dragging in the window work area.

The default behaviour when rendering graphics in Qt is to swap the red
and blue components of colours so that they display correctly in RISC OS.
On newer hardware, for example IGEPv5, RISC OS may already make allowances
for swapping the red and blue. In such cases, the swapping that Qt does
will not be required and can be switched off by issuing the following
command at the command line.

*set Qt$NoRedBlueSwap 1

This will take effect in any program that is subsequently run, but will not
affect those already running.


If you find that sites default to the mobile version, then setting the
User Agent from the Tools menu to, eg, Internet Explorer should ensure
that the full versions of sites are visited instead.

All config/cache files are saved in !Boot.Choices.Qt5. In future, the cache
files should be moved to !Scrap.

Although reasonably stable in use, there are issues:

* Downloading of web pages can sometimes 'stick' for no apparent reason.
* On the IGEPv5 platform logical address space exhaustion can be a
problem.
