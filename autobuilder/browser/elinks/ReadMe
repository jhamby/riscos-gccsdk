About
-----

ELinks is an extended developmental version of Links, a textual webbrowser,
similar to "Lynx".


Installing
----------

Place the ELinks binary anywhere you like - somewhere in the Run$Path
may be sensible.


Usage
------

ELinks is designed to work running as an "ANSI Task" under Nettle. Its use
running outside of Nettle is limited.

ELinks also requires a large wimpslot - greater than about 2MB before it will
start.

ELinks is started by typing "elinks" into the command dialogue of Nettle as an ANSI task, with an optional URL as a parameter.

If you do no specify a URL, it will start with a blank screen.  Press 'G'
to enter a URL.


Colour
------

The default setup in elinks is for black and white.  To get colour
access the menu bar (escape or mouse click on top line), then Setup
menu -> Terminal Options -> Click Color -> Ok.
