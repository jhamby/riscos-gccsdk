About RISC OS Firefox
----------------------

Firefox was ported to RISC OS to fill the requirement for a comprehensive
browsing solution.  Based upon the original Mozilla and Netscape work, Firefox
is potentially able to access almost any website, and is one of the most widely
used browsers.  Its open source nature means that anyone inside or outside
RISC OS development can update it.  These features made it an ideal choice for
porting to RISC OS.

Firefox was ported to RISC OS by Peter Naulls under the Unix Porting
Project (now part of riscos.info) as part of a programme of bringing
Unix programs to RISC OS in order to fill gaps in the application space.
Firefox was only possible at all because it built upon work by the GCCSDK
team with GCC and UnixLib and current work by the project such as the ChoX11
library.   And of course, the many subscribers to the project who made it
financially viable.  Thanks for supporting the future of RISC OS.

The ongoing development is only possible with donations to the project.
See http://www.riscos.info/index.php/Donations for more details.


This Version
------------

This version was made specifically for RiscPC-class machines (including
older versions of VirtualRPC).  Its performance will not be as good
as the regular version, as it uses slower code to avoid half-word instructions
and lacks other optimisations for StrongARM and later.

There is no support whatsoever for this version.  It was made only because
it was preferable to having RiscPC users make use of the old Firefox 1.5
port.


Changes
-------

Release 4 (Feburary 2008)

This fixes minor issues with the previous release.  The code is otherwise the same,
apart from being compiled to support RiscPCs.

- Some widget handling fixes promised in the last release didn't make it, these
  are now included, and some additional debugging is disabled.
- There were some issues with the packaging process which meant that the wrong
  name was in the RiscPkg information.  Unfortunately, RiscPkg still doesn't
  like the resulting package much.


Release 3 (February 2008)

This is a bug fix release only.  There are no other RISC OS-specific enhancements.

- Update to upstream Firefox 2.0.0.12 (from 2.0.0.1), see:
  http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/firefox/2.0.0.12/releasenotes/
  and older URLs.  This means many security and stability fixes.
- Build with GCC 4.1, but converted to AOF using new tool.  Since dynamic
  linking is not yet production ready, ELFLoader is not required for this
  version.
- Fixes situation of not being able to start Firefox at all on many systems.
- Iconbar quit performs proper shutdown sequence.
- Removes "mystery" 1x1 pixel window.
- Fixes vanishing panes in some tab closing combinations.
- Fixes bookmark handling.
- Work around for odd spacing in some menu items until keyboard shortcuts are implemented.
- Possibly some incidental speed improvements.


Release 2 (December 2006)

- Firefox becomes the first RISC OS GCC 4.1 application released
- RISC OS Menus and iconbar icon enabled, although functionality is incomplete
- !UnixHome not used any longer - preferences stored in standard RISC OS
  Choices directory - Choices:Mozilla.Firefox
- Handling of multiple windows fixed - this was causing Firefox to mysteriously
  exit at times, particularly those with pop up windows like banking sites.
- Updated to the upstream 2.0.0.1 version.


Release 1 (November 2006)

- First release of version 2 of Firefox for RISC OS


I just want to run it
---------------------

Merge these with your !System:

Tinct
  http://www.tinct.net/download/tinct_013.zip
SharedUnixLibrary
 http://www.riscos.info/downloads/gccsdk/sharedunixlib/sharedunixlib.zip


Running First Time
------------------

It takes longer the first time due to creation of profiles.  Please be
patient before the first window opens.  There is a desktop refresh which
I was not able to fix for this release.


Reporting bugs
--------------

Please don't report any bugs against this version.


Troubleshooting
---------------

You might have problems starting up, especially if you had an aborted
start up from a previous version.  In this case, I recommend you
delete Choices:Mozilla.Firefox and try again.
