# The path of this file must be set in the system variable ENV
# It can have any name or path but needs to be something unixlib/dash can read
# The ENV variable (and file pointed to) is only read when starting dash interactively.
# Examples that would replace a previously set PATH (by RISC OS or dash)
# export PATH=\<CoreUtils\$Dir\>
# Generally unixlib converts either full RISC OS or full unix paths. 
# The second entry here for the <Dash$Dir>.bin is quirky, it mixes path types
# export PATH=/ADFS::4.$/Utilities/!CoreUtils;\<Dash\$Dir\>/bin
printf "dash_init has been run\n"
