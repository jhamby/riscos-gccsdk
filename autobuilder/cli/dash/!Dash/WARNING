Although dash can run cleanly with the correct commands and scripts, and if things go wrong usually will
stop with an error message, it is easily possible to cause wimp crashes and potentially FS corruption.
Where possible, use RAM or a less important drive at least until problems are thoroughly sorted.
In particular, getting the working directory away from (the default) main boot drive would be wise.

Trying to run a bash script before it's syntax is changed for dash/ash is a likely problem.
Ubuntu spent some time changing scripts to suit dash when they adopted it for booting.
