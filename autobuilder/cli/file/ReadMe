Before you start
----------------

Please obtain !UnixHome from

    http://www.chocky.org/unix/


Installing
----------

Place the file binary anywhere you like - somewhere in the Run$Path
may be sensible.   File's magic config file is in a dummy !UnixHome
application.  Place this over the top of the real !UnixHome application.



Usage
-----

File is used by simply typing "file <filename>" to identify the content
of a file.  n.b.  file intentionally accepts only RISC OS format filenames,
not Unix format ones like some other ports.
