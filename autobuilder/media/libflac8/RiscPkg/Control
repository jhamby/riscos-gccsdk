Description: Free Lossless Audio Codec - C development library 
 FLAC stands for Free Lossless Audio Codec. Grossly oversimplified, FLAC is
 similar to MP3, but lossless.  The FLAC project consists of:
 .
 * The stream format
 * libFLAC, which implements a reference encoder, stream decoder, and file
   decoder
 * flac, which is a command-line wrapper around libFLAC to encode and decode
   .flac files
 * Input plugins for various music players (Winamp, XMMS, and more in the
   works)
 .
 This package contains the development library libFLAC.
