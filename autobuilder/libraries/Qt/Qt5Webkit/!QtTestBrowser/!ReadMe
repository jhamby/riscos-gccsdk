This is the Qt5Webkit/QtTestBrowser for RISC OS.

Currently, only Webkit1 is built, Webkit2 may follow if there are
no serious show stoppers.

The purpose of this browser is to test the functionality of Qt5Webkit.
It is not designed to be a fully fledged browser, so there are no
bookmarks or tabs.


Installation
------------

Library/package dependencies:

Qt5Base
LevelDB
libz
libpng12
icu (libicui18n, libicuuc, libicudata)
libfontconfig
libfreetype
libexpat
libjpeg
sqlite3

Please be aware that you require at least r6818 of libunixlib for
QtTestBrowser to work.

Font dependencies (supplied with Qt5Base):

ttf-vera
ttf-dejavu

These are supplied in Qt5Base, in a form that can be dragged over
!UnixFont to install them. Loading speeds may be improved by issuing
the command fc-cache at the command line (!UnixFC must also have been
seen by the filer). Note, fc-cache appears to be quite slow on a
RaspberryPi so please do be patient.


JIT
---
The JIT is currently disabled as I'm unsure of its stability and it
outputs VFP instructions for floating point code. I test on rpcemu
for convenience, so VFP instructions cause problems.
When enabled, the JIT is likely to be ARMv6+ only. I did a lot of
work on making it ARMv4 compatible, but with no FPA or soft float
library support, it looks like that work was in vain.


Usage
-----
Windows are resized by shift dragging within the workarea.


Memory requirements
-------------------
On initial loading, shared library usage is about 90MB. There are a number
of other dynamic areas in use:

VM Stack - seems fixed at 4MB - max. size set to 8MB.
GC Heap - variable use - max. set to 100MB.
Fast Malloc - very little use - max. size set to 200KB.
JIT Code (when JIT enabled) - max. size set to 10MB.


Known problems
--------------
Crashes have been observed in QRiscosScreen::windowFromId().
Menus have title bars when they shouldn't.
QtWebkit is obsolete (replaced by QtWebEngine).
