This is a RISC OS port of the base libraries of Qt5.

Installation
------------

Library dependencies:

libz
libpng12
icu (libicui18n, libicuuc, libicudata)
libfontconfig
libfreetype
libexpat

Font dependencies (supplied with Qt):

ttf-vera
ttf-dejavu

These are supplied in a form that can be dragged over !UnixFont to install
them. Loading speeds may be improved by issuing the command fc-cache at
the command line (!UnixFC must also have been seen by the filer).
Note, fc-cache appears to be quite slow on a RaspberryPi so be patient.


Usage notes
-----------
Use Select drag with shift held down to resize windows.


Porting notes
-------------
A large number of the patches to the core libraries relate to a problem
with QChar. This class consists of a single short int, meaning that
sizeof(QChar) is expected to be 2. This is important when QChar is used
in an array; obviously, this is common when dealing with strings.
In RISC OS QChar is padded to 4 bytes (ie, sizeof (QChar) == 4). To fix
this we use the packed attribute to force the compiler to remove the
padding, but this creates a new problem in the form of a compile time error
because the class contains at least one member function that returns a
reference to the enclosed short int:

inline ushort &unicode() { return ucs; }

where ucs is the short int data member.
The only solution is to change this to:

inline ushort *unicode() { return ucs; }

and fix up all call sites to dereference the returned pointer. Making these
changes was tedious, but it worked.



The main RISC OS specific code is located at src/plugins/platforms/riscos
as a plugin loaded by dlopen (in line with the other platforms).

32bit sprites are used as window backing stores and Qt paints directly
into them. These are then rendered in the WIMP redraw loop of the window
using either osspriteop_put_sprite_user_coords when rendering to a
32bit mode or xosspriteop_put_sprite_scaled when translation is required
to a mode of a different depth.

Known problems/ToDo
-------------------
Menu windows have a title bar when they probably shouldn't.
When rendering images (png/jpg/gif?), 2 of the colour components (blue/green?)
are swapped.
