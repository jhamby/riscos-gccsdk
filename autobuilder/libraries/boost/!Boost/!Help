Boost libraries for RISC OS

This application holds a copy of the Boost C++ libraries
packaged for use on RISC OS.

The Boost libraries are packaged into several parts all
of which need the LibBoost-Dev package (which includes this
help file) installed first.

Search the autobuilder website (or your package manager)
for the packages starting with LibBoost to see all the
packages.

The LibBoost-Doc package is very large and once installed
provides Examples in the examples subdirectory and
HTML documentation in the html directory.

To use header only boost libraries add
  -IBoost:
to the c++ command line.

For components with a static library add
 -LBoost: -l<libname>
to the link line where libname is the name of the
static library.

The boost libraries consist of a lot of header files
so it may be necessary to increase the amount of
memory available to the preprocessor.

On RISC OS 5 allow the preprocessor to use a larger
wimpslot with:
Unset cc1plus$Heap

On other versions of RISC OS allow more memory to the
preprocessor with:
SetEval cc1plus$HeapMax 96
(for 96 Megabytes)

More details of the Boost C++ libraries can be found at:
   www.boost.org

Current status
--------------

As the autobuilder automatically builds these packages
there is a chance this help file will not be up to date
with the latest version.

On 16th March 2011:
- Only provides static single and multi threading version
  of the libraries.
- filesystem module compiles but has not been properly
  adjusted for RISC OS filenames.
- mpl, graph and python libraries don't compile
- math may be missing some libraries
- None of the tools are provided.
- Very little testing has been done.
