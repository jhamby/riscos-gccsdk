Boost libraries for RISC OS

This application holds a copy of the Boost C++ libraries
packaged for use on RISC OS.

The Boost libraries are packaged into several parts all
of which need the LibBoost-Dev package (which includes this
help file) installed first.

Search the autobuilder website (or your package manager)
for the packages starting with LibBoost to see all the
packages.

The LibBoost-Doc package is very large and once installed
provides Examples in the examples subdirectory and
HTML documentation in the html directory.

To use header only boost libraries add
  -IBoost:
to the c++ command line.

For components with a static library add
 -LBoost: -l<libname>
to the link line where libname is the name of the
static library.

More details of the Boost C++ libraries can be found at:
   www.boost.org

Current status
--------------

As the autobuilder automatically builds these packages
there is a chance this help file will be up to date
with the latest version.

On 1st March 2011:
- Only provides static single and multi threading version
  of the libraries.
- filesystem module compiles but has not been properly
  adjusted for RISC OS filenames.
- mpl, graph and python libraries don't compile
- math may be missing some libraries
- None of the tools are provided.
- Very little testing has been done.
