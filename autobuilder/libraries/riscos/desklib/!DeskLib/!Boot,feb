| Set up the DeskLib: path
| DeskLib_User: is the path to user-written functions.
| DeskLib_Core: is the path to the released DeskLb functions.

| This enables users to have their own DeskLib libraries in
| the !DLUser directory and not have to worry about copying
| headers into !DeskLib etc. It also makes installing new
| versions of DeskLib easier - just keep your old !DLUser
| and replace your old !DeskLib.


| Uncomment these if you are using EasyC/EasyC++
| They will have no effect if you don't use EasyC(++) apart
| from taking up a bit of system-variable space.

| Commented out as of 26/4/07 - EasyC now obsolete. MoreLib & MoreHdr probably not registered
|If "<DeskLib$Dir>"="" Then Set MoreLib$Dir <MoreLib$Dir>,<Obey$Dir>.o.
|If "<DeskLib$Dir>"="" Then Set MoreHdr$Dir <MoreHdr$Dir>,<Obey$Dir>.
