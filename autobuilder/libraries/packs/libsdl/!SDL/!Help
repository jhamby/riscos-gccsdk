This is the RISC OS port of SDL and some of the libraries based
upon it.

The libraries were all built using the autobuilder cross-compiled
using the GCCSDK against UnixLib.

See www.riscos.info for more information on the GCCSDK and
the autobuilder.

To use the main SDL library add -ISDL:include if the
headers are specified using the SDL subdirectory or
-I/SDL:include/SDL if just using the header names.

Link using -LSDL:lib -lSDL

Other libraries may be required from the !LibU application
for some of the additional SDL based libraries. In this
case you will have to add -LLibU:lib and the libraries to
the link line.

Examples:

Compiling the playmus.c SDL_Mixer example:

gcc -I/SDL:include/SDL -LSDL:lib -LLibU:lib -lSDL -lSDL_mixer
  -lvorbis -logg -lvorbisfile -lvorbisenc -o playmusic playmus.c

Compiling the showimage.c SDL_Image example:

gcc -I/SDL:include/SDL -LSDL:lib -LLibU:lib -lSDL_Image -lSDL
  -ltiff -ljpeg -lpng12 -lz -o showimage showimage.c

(Note the above should only be on one line and have been
split here for clarity)

The most common documents have been copied to the doc
subdirectory.

The sources for the libraries whose license requires the
source to be available are in a companion zip file that
should be available in the same location you downloaded
this from. It is normally named sdl-xxx-src.zip, where
xxx is the version number.

These source zip files may include extra documentation
and examples.
