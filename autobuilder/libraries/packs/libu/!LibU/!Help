This application provides libraries built using the autobuilder
for use on RISC OS.

All the libraries were cross-compiled with the GCCSDK against
the unixlib library.

Details of the autobuilder and the GCCSDK can be found at
www.riscos.info.

This application sets a path variable called LibU that can
be used with your compile and link commands as follows:

To include the headers add:

   -ILibU:include

To link the libraries add:

   -LLibU:lib -l<library name>

where <library name> is the name of the library. If the library
name starts with lib you do not need to include this.

e.g. to link with zlib (library name libz) use:

 -LLibU:lib -lz

The standard documents for a library are copied to the doc
directory in a subdirectory named after the library. This
usually includes a README file and some kind of copyright
or license file.

More documentation for some of the libraries is contained in
the man directory that contains unix man pages that have
been automatically converted to HTML.

The sources subdirectory contains the source code in a zip
file from any libraries that require that the source code
is made available with a binary distribution. These zip
files sometime also contain extra documentation and example
files.

The libraries are:
