The easiest way to use these examples is to set their containing
directory as the current directory and then call them directly
from a taskwindow.

The three programs in the examples directory all take a single
argument that gives a filename to write the result to, for
example:

*cairosimple /ram:$/simple-image.png
*cairoshape /ram:$/shape-image.png
*cairotwisted /ram:$/twisted-image.png

The pango-view program is a bit more complex:

*pango-view --no-display --output=/ram:$/image.png HELLO.txt

where HELLO.txt is one of the supplied text files.
The result will likely depend on which Truetype fonts are installed
in !UnixFont.

In all cases, the result is a PNG file that can be viewed in,
for example, !Netsurf.
