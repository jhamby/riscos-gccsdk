Cairo V1.12.16
--------------

This version of Cairo does not include an XLib surface. It has deliberately been
disabled in an attempt to create a RISC OS specific solution.

--

This version of Cairo includes a RISC OS Sprite Surface. Based on the standard
Cairo Image surface, anything that can be rendered to an Image surface
can be rendered to a RISC OS Sprite Surface.

To use, simply replace a call to cairo_image_surface_create with a call to
cairo_riscos_sprite_surface_create. The arguments and return type are
identical, eg:

    cairo_surface_t *surface =
	cairo_riscos_sprite_surface_create (CAIRO_FORMAT_ARGB32, 256, 256);

This will create a sprite 256 pixels wide by 256 pixels high. All cairo operations
that act on the surface are then used in the same way.

To save the surface as a sprite file, use a call like:

    cairo_riscos_sprite_surface_write_to_file (surface, "ram:$.sprite-file");

It can also be saved as a PNG file:

    cairo_surface_write_to_png (surface, "ram:$.png-file");

Although there is some code in the library to render RISC OS Fonts, it's not
adequate for serious use. Instead, freetype/fontconfig is known to give
good results using TrueType fonts.
