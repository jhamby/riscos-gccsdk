This is an alpha version of GTK 3.8.6 and is a work in progress.

Notes
-----
* Use SELECT shift drag to resize windows.

* GTK+3 is customisable by creating the file:

!Boot.Choices.config.gtk-3/0.gtk/css

and uses a subset of the CSS3 standard.

* Uses the RISC OS Sprite Surface in Cairo as a backing store
which is then rendered into a window.


Known problems/things to fix (not a complete list)
----------------------------
* Clicking a spin button causes an infinite update loop.
* Text entry - sometimes, key presses are interpreted as if a modifier
key was pressed, eg, pressing Q will cause the program to quit
as if ctrl-Q was pressed instead of inserting the Q character
at the cursor.
* There is no visible text entry cursor.
