This is GTK 3.8.6.

Notes
-----
* The current screen mode is used to determine the ordering of the red
and blue pixel components. GDK then ensures via Cairo that the sprite
surfaces created use the same ordering. This behaviour can be overridden
using the --swap-redblue=[yes,1,no,0] command line option.

* The toolbox can be used by calling gdk_riscos_enable_toolbox before opening
the display. The windows created by GDK are still WIMP only though, and are not
toolbox objects.

* Use SELECT shift drag to resize windows.

* GTK+3 is customisable by creating the file:

!Boot.Choices.config.gtk-3/0.gtk/css

and uses a subset of the CSS3 standard.

* Uses the RISC OS Sprite Surface in Cairo as a backing store
which is then rendered into a window.


Known problems/things to fix (not a complete list)
----------------------------
* Clicking a spin button causes an infinite update loop.
* Text entry - sometimes, key presses are interpreted as if a modifier
key was pressed, eg, pressing Q will cause the program to quit
as if ctrl-Q was pressed instead of inserting the Q character
at the cursor.
