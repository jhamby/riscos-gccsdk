Loaders location
----------------
The default loaders directory is:

/SharedLibs:lib/abi-2.0/gdk-pixbuf-2.0/2.10.0/loaders

That is, abi-2.0 (as used by versions of GCC from V4.6
onwards) is assumed.

This default can be overridden by using the command:

*set GDK_PIXBUF_MODULEDIR /SharedLibs:lib/abi-1.0/gdk-pixbuf-2.0/2.10.0/loaders

for abi-1.0 (GCC v4.1.2) or to use any other location.

Utilities
---------
Two utilities are provided:

gdk-pixbuf-query-loaders
This program is used to scan the available loaders and
cache information about what formats they understand.
The results are sent to standard output for redirection
to a cache file. Normally, the results would be stored
in a file called loaders.cache located at
/SharedLibs:lib/abi-2.0/gdk-pixbuf-2.0/2.10.0/.
Such a file is provided for the loaders that are built
with libgdk-pixbuf, so normally this utility will not
be required unless loaders are added from somewhere else.

gdk-pixbuf-csource
This program is used to convert a graphic into a format
that can be included in C source files.

Please see the relevant man pages for further details
about these utilities.
