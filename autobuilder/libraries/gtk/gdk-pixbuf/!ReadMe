Loaders location
----------------
The loaders directory is:

/SharedLibs:lib/abi-2.0/gdk-pixbuf-2.0/2.10.0/loaders

for GCC4 and

/SharedLibs:lib/armeabi/gdk-pixbuf-2.0/2.10.0/loaders

for newer versions of GCC.

Utilities
---------
Two utilities are provided:

gdk-pixbuf-query-loaders
This program is used to scan the available loaders and
cache information about what formats they understand.
The results are sent to standard output for redirection
to a cache file. Normally, the results would be stored
in a file called loaders.cache located at
/SharedLibs:lib/abi-2.0/gdk-pixbuf-2.0/2.10.0/.
Such a file is provided for the loaders that are built
with libgdk-pixbuf, so normally this utility will not
be required unless loaders are added from somewhere else.

gdk-pixbuf-csource
This program is used to convert a graphic into a format
that can be included in C source files.

Please see the relevant man pages for further details
about these utilities.
