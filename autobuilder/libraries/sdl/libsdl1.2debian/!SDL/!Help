This is the RISC OS port of Simple Direct Media Layer (SDL)
1.2 branch.

The library was built using the autobuilder cross-compiled
using the GCCSDK against UnixLib.

See www.riscos.info for more information on the GCCSDK and
the autobuilder.

To use the main SDL library add -ISDL12: if the
headers are specified using the SDL subdirectory or
-ISDL12:SDL if just using the header names.

Link using -LSDL12: -lSDL

See the doc subdirectory for more documentation and/or
