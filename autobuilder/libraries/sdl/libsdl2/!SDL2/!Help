This is the RISC OS port of Simple DirectMedia Layer 2 (SDL2).

The library was built using the autobuilder cross-compiled
using the GCCSDK against UnixLib.

See www.riscos.info for more information on the GCCSDK and
the autobuilder.

To use the main SDL2 library, add -ISDL2: to the compile flags
and link using -LSDL2: -lSDL
