	* ro-config: Set CFLAGS to -O3, which ensures optimization in
          most places.  

Fri Jul 31 14:18:41 PDT 2009  Peter Naulls  <peter@chocky.org>

	* ro-install: Simply skip -m and -g flags.  Permissions aren't
          very interesting to us, sometimes cause problems when deleting
          and can confuse the script later.

Tue Jul 28 12:15:51 PDT 2009  Peter Naulls  <peter@chocky.org>

	* ro-config: Include -rpath-link as a linker flag, to help locating
          shared library dependencies.  Simplify processing by using sed -i.
	* ro-pkg-config: No longer pass -static.
	* ro-path: Remove old comment about -static.

Wed May 27 21:44:59 PDT 2009  Peter Naulls  <peter@chocky.org>

	* ro-path: Also export ASASM to asasm path.

Fri Dec  5 22:05:28 CET 2008  John Tytgat  <John.Tytgat@aaug.net>

	* ro-config: Don't have RO_SHAREDLIBS hardwired to 'yes' (partially
	reverting r3498).

Wed Dec  3 02:33:14 CET 2008  John Tytgat  <John.Tytgat@aaug.net>

	* ro-install: when called in 'install' mode, make sure the destination
	parent directory is always existing before calling install'.

Sun Nov 30 16:38:49 CET 2008  John Tytgat  <John.Tytgat@aaug.net>

	* ro-config: Define archive_cmds_need_lc to no to prevent configure
	generating a libtool script which adds -lc to our linker lines.

Mon Aug 18 21:14:29 PDT 2008  Peter Naulls  <peter@chocky.org>

	* ro-config: Improve static vs dynamic configuration.  
	Set ac_cv_va_copy for popt.

Sun Jul  6 17:19:12 PDT 2008  Peter Naulls  <peter@chocky.org>

	* ro-config: Always build dynamic and static libraries by default.
	Pass ld for linker instead of GCC, since configure expects this
	for dymamic linking - previously we didn't since under AOF we
	never referred directly to drlink.

Sat Jun  7 13:32:13 PDT 2008  Peter Naulls  <peter@chocky.org>

	* ro-config: Additional library path for shared library linking,
	  do have statfs.h.

Thu Mar 20 21:11:19 CET 2008  John Tytgat  <John.Tytgat@aaug.net>

	* ChangeLog: reformat.
	* ro-config: changed RO_NOSTATIC into RO_SHAREDLIBS; add -static to
	CFLAGS when doing static builds; go for consistent two space
	indentation; lowercased internal variables; renamed DISTCC to
	ro_distcc; likewise for HOST/ro_host, BUILD/ro_build, TARGET/ro_target,
	PREFIX/ro_prefix, WITHLIBS/ro_withlibs, X/ro_x, SHARED/ro_shared,
	STATIC/ro_static, TCLTK/ro_tcltk, THREADS/ro_threads, NATIVE/ro_native
	ARCHITECTURE/ro_architecture, SSL/ro_ssl, NLS/ro_nls,
	CPARAMS/ro_cparams; renamed RO_NOSTATIC to RO_SHAREDLIBS; removed
	exeext and extension handling for !RunImage binary; use RO_SHAREDLIBS
	test for the --{enable,disable}-{shared,static} massaging.
	* ro-make: contents test for RO_DIST is lowercase 'yes' i.s.o. 'YES'.
	* PortingTools.html: actualised, documented the public RO_ prefixed
	parameters.

Wed Feb 27 19:23:33 PST 2008  Peter Naulls  <peter@chocky.org>

	* ro-config: Add CPP, RAWCPP variables, set sys/vfs.h available.
	* uname: Add more flags.

Thu Jan 17 16:24:54 PST 2008  Peter Naulls  <peter@chocky.org>

	* ro-pkg-config: Additional path for pkgconfig.
	* ro-config: Make values of CC/CXX easier to grab from here.
	* ro-make, ro-path: Make values of CC/CXX more generally available.
	* ro-install: Revert earlier parameter handling change; otherwise
	options are not handled - improve the issue this was meant to solve
	in a different way in future.

Sat Jan 12 19:43:48 PST 2008  Peter Naulls  <peter@chocky.org>

	* ro-config: autoconf 2.12 handling. Replace -lX11 with -lCX11 -lDesk.
	Ensure binaries really are static - force variables and libtool
	values.
	* mkdir: Addition of mkdir for package creation handling
	* ro-install: Mostly remove need for mkdir in setvars.

Mon Dec 24 20:28:18 UTC 2007  Peter Naulls  <peter@chocky.org>

	* Reinstate ,e1f addition.

Mon Dec 24 18:31:42 UTC 2007  Peter Naulls  <peter@chocky.org>

	* ChangeLog started for Porting Scripts
	* ro-ar: Removed.  This is an anachronism from AOF tools - should use
	the version from binutils.
