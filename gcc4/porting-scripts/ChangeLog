Sun Feb  7 20:41:28 PST 2010  Peter Naulls  <peter@chocky.org>

	* ro-install: Improve last change.

Sun Feb  7 19:13:30 PST 2010  Peter Naulls  <peter@chocky.org>

	* ro-install: Remove and remove man3 symlinks only when required.

Fri Jan 15 12:03:00 PST 2010  Peter Naulls  <peter@chocky.org>

	* arm-unknown-riscos-gcc, gcc, g++, cpp, cc, c++: Install additional
          symlinks to ensure use of the wrappers, and avoid more patches.

Fri Jan 15 09:46:14 PST 2010  Peter Naulls  <peter@chocky.org>

        * ro-config, ro-path, arm-unknown-riscos-{cpp,gcc,g++}: Relegate
          the problem of adding linker and include paths to wrapper
          scripts instead of adding them during configuration, which
          in any case isn't always possible.  This ensures correct order,
          and also allows us to ditch a load of patches.

Mon Jan  4 16:58:27 PST 2010  Peter Naulls  <peter@chocky.org>

	* ro-install, mv: Override the 'mv' command when creating
          library packages or installing as we do for 'cp'.

Mon Nov 16 10:27:23 PST 2009  Peter Naulls  <peter@chocky.org>

	* ro-config: Add possible --prefix-dir alternative.  This is 
          for the benefit of OpenTTD.

Mon Aug 24 10:43:10 PDT 2009  Peter Naulls  <peter@chocky.org>

	* ro-config: Remove old SDL vs vorbis hack.  This made sense once,
          but now makes matters worse.

Thu Aug 13 08:21:22 PDT 2009  Peter Naulls  <peter@chocky.org>

	* ro-ar: Use bash. Ensure destination directory exists.

Mon Aug 10 10:06:11 PDT 2009  Peter Naulls  <peter@chocky.org>

	* ro-config: Remove old application-specific autoconf values.
          If these are still valid, then they should be added to the
          relevant setvars script.  Add RO_APPSHARED variable, so
          let the application set the precise shared vs static
          flags, since we can't guess correctly 100% of the time.
        * ro-install: Add an additional PIC check for extra static
          libtool archives we create.

Wed Aug  5 18:36:29 PDT 2009  Peter Naulls  <peter@chocky.org>

	* ro-ar, ro-config, ro-install:  Work around for problems where
          libtool puts PIC objects in subdirectory archives and they end
          up in the final static libraries.  We do this by wrapping up
          'ar' and generating additional libraries that are static only.

Tue Aug  4 14:36:18 PDT 2009  Peter Naulls  <peter@chocky.org>

	* ro-install: Fail attempt to install static archive if it
          contains PIC objects.

Sun Aug  2 07:40:38 PDT 2009  Peter Naulls  <peter@chocky.org>

	* ro-config: Set CFLAGS to -O3, which ensures optimization in
          most places.  

Fri Jul 31 14:18:41 PDT 2009  Peter Naulls  <peter@chocky.org>

	* ro-install: Simply skip -m and -g flags.  Permissions aren't
          very interesting to us, sometimes cause problems when deleting
          and can confuse the script later.

Tue Jul 28 12:15:51 PDT 2009  Peter Naulls  <peter@chocky.org>

	* ro-config: Include -rpath-link as a linker flag, to help locating
          shared library dependencies.  Simplify processing by using sed -i.
	* ro-pkg-config: No longer pass -static.
	* ro-path: Remove old comment about -static.

Wed May 27 21:44:59 PDT 2009  Peter Naulls  <peter@chocky.org>

	* ro-path: Also export ASASM to asasm path.

Fri Dec  5 22:05:28 CET 2008  John Tytgat  <John.Tytgat@aaug.net>

	* ro-config: Don't have RO_SHAREDLIBS hardwired to 'yes' (partially
	reverting r3498).

Wed Dec  3 02:33:14 CET 2008  John Tytgat  <John.Tytgat@aaug.net>

	* ro-install: when called in 'install' mode, make sure the destination
	parent directory is always existing before calling install'.

Sun Nov 30 16:38:49 CET 2008  John Tytgat  <John.Tytgat@aaug.net>

	* ro-config: Define archive_cmds_need_lc to no to prevent configure
	generating a libtool script which adds -lc to our linker lines.

Mon Aug 18 21:14:29 PDT 2008  Peter Naulls  <peter@chocky.org>

	* ro-config: Improve static vs dynamic configuration.  
	Set ac_cv_va_copy for popt.

Sun Jul  6 17:19:12 PDT 2008  Peter Naulls  <peter@chocky.org>

	* ro-config: Always build dynamic and static libraries by default.
	Pass ld for linker instead of GCC, since configure expects this
	for dymamic linking - previously we didn't since under AOF we
	never referred directly to drlink.

Sat Jun  7 13:32:13 PDT 2008  Peter Naulls  <peter@chocky.org>

	* ro-config: Additional library path for shared library linking,
	  do have statfs.h.

Thu Mar 20 21:11:19 CET 2008  John Tytgat  <John.Tytgat@aaug.net>

	* ChangeLog: reformat.
	* ro-config: changed RO_NOSTATIC into RO_SHAREDLIBS; add -static to
	CFLAGS when doing static builds; go for consistent two space
	indentation; lowercased internal variables; renamed DISTCC to
	ro_distcc; likewise for HOST/ro_host, BUILD/ro_build, TARGET/ro_target,
	PREFIX/ro_prefix, WITHLIBS/ro_withlibs, X/ro_x, SHARED/ro_shared,
	STATIC/ro_static, TCLTK/ro_tcltk, THREADS/ro_threads, NATIVE/ro_native
	ARCHITECTURE/ro_architecture, SSL/ro_ssl, NLS/ro_nls,
	CPARAMS/ro_cparams; renamed RO_NOSTATIC to RO_SHAREDLIBS; removed
	exeext and extension handling for !RunImage binary; use RO_SHAREDLIBS
	test for the --{enable,disable}-{shared,static} massaging.
	* ro-make: contents test for RO_DIST is lowercase 'yes' i.s.o. 'YES'.
	* PortingTools.html: actualised, documented the public RO_ prefixed
	parameters.

Wed Feb 27 19:23:33 PST 2008  Peter Naulls  <peter@chocky.org>

	* ro-config: Add CPP, RAWCPP variables, set sys/vfs.h available.
	* uname: Add more flags.

Thu Jan 17 16:24:54 PST 2008  Peter Naulls  <peter@chocky.org>

	* ro-pkg-config: Additional path for pkgconfig.
	* ro-config: Make values of CC/CXX easier to grab from here.
	* ro-make, ro-path: Make values of CC/CXX more generally available.
	* ro-install: Revert earlier parameter handling change; otherwise
	options are not handled - improve the issue this was meant to solve
	in a different way in future.

Sat Jan 12 19:43:48 PST 2008  Peter Naulls  <peter@chocky.org>

	* ro-config: autoconf 2.12 handling. Replace -lX11 with -lCX11 -lDesk.
	Ensure binaries really are static - force variables and libtool
	values.
	* mkdir: Addition of mkdir for package creation handling
	* ro-install: Mostly remove need for mkdir in setvars.

Mon Dec 24 20:28:18 UTC 2007  Peter Naulls  <peter@chocky.org>

	* Reinstate ,e1f addition.

Mon Dec 24 18:31:42 UTC 2007  Peter Naulls  <peter@chocky.org>

	* ChangeLog started for Porting Scripts
	* ro-ar: Removed.  This is an anachronism from AOF tools - should use
	the version from binutils.
