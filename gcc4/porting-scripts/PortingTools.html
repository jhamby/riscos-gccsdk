<h3>The Idea</h3>

<p>To greatly simplify the repetitive tasks when cross compiling Unix programs
to RISC OS, especially when using GNU autoconf.  The tools will work most
effectively (for purposes of fetching source) on a Debian system, but they
will also work on other systems on which GCCSDK also works.</p>

<p>We have found that there are many problems which are the same, when
converting Unix programs.  Some of these come about because of the use
of the ,e1f extension which can confuse scripts and makefiles which have
not been properly written to expect this (although there is a growing
trend to improve this, as we see support for .exe in Cygwin, for example).</p>

<p>There are other such mundane things as setting paths, faking the system
type and passing often used flags to configure.</p>

<p>It is also desirable to be able to run "make install", as this enables
us to build a proper cross compiling environment, without having to
fiddle about with libraries, paths, etc.</p>

<p></p>

<h3>Solution</h3>

<p>Have a variety of wrappers to some of the usual Unix tools to pass
appropriate options, or set variables, etc beforehand.  Notably,
make, install and configure.</p>

<p>These wrappers are stored in a subdirectory "env" created under the
normal structure for the cross compiler (specified by the --with-riscos-env
parameter of the GCCSDK configure).  This directoy is on this system
currently located at GCCSDK_ENV and more generally accessible via the
environment variable GCCSDK_INSTALL_ENV and contains directories for the
usual include, lib, bin, etc, info, man and X11 setup.</p>

<p></p>

<h3>Setup</h3>

<p>The tools are installed as part of the GCCSDK build.
See the <a href="http://gccsdk.riscos.info/">GCCSDK page</a> for more details.</p>

<p></p>


<hr>

<h3>External parameters</h3>

<p>The Porting Tools accept a couple of options which are specified by means of environment
variables all being prefixed by &quot;RO_&quot;.  It is not necessary to have them
defined as each one has a suitable default value.</p>

<h4>RO_CPATH</h4>

<p>RO_CPATH specifies a directory which is used to locate the configure
script.  When RO_CPATH is not specified the current directory will be used.</p>

<p>ro-config will use this directory to look for a configure script.  When there is no
configure script in that directory, the parent directory will used instead. When the
--ro-recurse ro-config option is given, all configure scripts in the subdirectories
will be processed by ro-config too.</p>

<h4>RO_DIST</h4>

<p>RO_DIST is used by ro-config and ro-make and needs to be set to
&quot;yes&quot; when you want to make use of &quot;distcc&quot; to do
distributed building.</p>

<h4>RO_PKG</h4>

<p>Mainly used by Autobuilder to implement the packaging process (typically
during &quot;make install&quot;).</p>

<h4>RO_SHAREDLIBS</h4>

<p>When RO_SHAREDLIBS is set to &quot;yes&quot; the configure options are tuned to
allow shared builds.  Otherwise they are tuned for static builds.</p>

Aside, we use lower case &quot;ro_&quot; shell and environment variables to
indicate internal Porting Tools variables.  They should not be used by other
parties.

<h3>The Porting Tools</h3>

<p>The porting tools currently for this build live in GCCSDK_ENV and
GCCSDK_ENV/bin and the cross compiler in GCCSDK_BIN. These directories are
defined by the GCCSDK configure script.</p>


<h4>ro-path</h4>

<p>Very simple, to add to the path before calling a command.  This
adds $GCCSDK_INSTALL_CROSSBIN and GCCSDK_ENV/bin to
the path before calling the supplied command.   This is useful to ensure
the RISC OS version of a tool gets called, and not the native version.</p>

<p>Also, some libraries set up a <i>libname</i>-config script in
GCCSDK_ENV/bin, and we should ensure that gets called, and
not the native one.</p>


<h4>ro-make</h4>

<p>This simply calls ro-path to invoke the native make program, and
possibly sets environment variables that could be used by the build.  In simple
makefiles, "gcc" or "cc" may be called directly, and this ensures
that the cross compiler is used.  In complex setups using configure,
even though the generated paths to most of the tools will be full,
it's typical to see "ar" and some other tools not using a path.</p>


<h4>ro-install</h4>

<p>Wrapper for the Unix "install" program.  Its purpose is to suffix
files with ,e1f if the filename does not exist. This enables
"make install" to succeed when installing binaries belonging to libraries
(even though we are generally not interested in those binaries, we
still want the install for headers and libs to work).</p>

<p>Additionally, if the first parameter ends with ,e1f (whether added
by the ro-install script, or passed in), then it adds it to the second
parameter too.  This ensures that installed RISC OS binaries have the
correct ,e1f extension.</p> 


<h4>uname</h4>

<p>This is simply a minimal version of the uname program on Unix,
to return RISC OS and ARM as the OS and processor type.</p>


<h4>cp, ln, mkdir, rm, rmdir</h4>

<p>These scripts are made to facilitate the packaging part while doing
&quot;make install&quot; or similar installation process during building. They
are typically disabled (i.e. calling their native implementation) when
the RO_PKG environment variable is not defined or an empty string.</p>


<h4>ro-config</h4>

<p>This is by far the most complex of all the scripts. Simply put, it just
calls configure, via the ro-path script passing on all given argument
parameters (except for &quot;--ro-recurse&quot;).</p>

<p>Additionally it also does do the following:</p>

<ul>
 <li><p>Massage the configure script, to correctly accept binaries using ,e1f.</p>

 <li><p>Set a considerable number of ac_cv_* and other variables used by
   various configure scripts.  This ensures that the configure script
   doesn't get upset when it tries to determine settings not possible
   in a cross compilation setup (or set correctly, when it defaults).</p>

 <li><p>Sets defaults, depending on the output of --help:</p>

  <pre>
     --host=arm-unknown-riscos
     --build=i686-linux
     --prefix=GCCSDK_ENV
     --x-libraries=GCCSDK_ENV/lib
     --x-includes=GCCSDK_ENV/include
     --disable-shared <i>(or: --enabled-shared=no)</i>
     --enable-static <i>(or: -static)</i>
     --with-glib-prefix=GCCSDK_ENV
     --with-gtk-prefix=GCCSDK_ENV
     --with-tclconfig=GCCSDK_ENV/lib/tcl8.4
     --with-tkconfig=GCCSDK_ENV/lib/tk8.4
     --disable-threads <i>(subject to change)</i>
     --with-build-cc=<i>... (used by bash)</i>
     --with-openssl=GCCSDK_ENV
     --disable-nls
     --ro-recursive
  </pre>   

  <p></p>

  <li><p>Sets typical variables used by Unix build systems:<br>
    CC, CPPFLAGS, LDFLAGS, CXX, CXXLIBS, AR, NM, RANLIB, INSTALL, STRIP</p>
</ul>


<p>
The script also accepts some settings: it is not always appropriate to
have the configure script in the same place as you're building (e.g. bash,
tcl, tk), so you can set RO_CPATH before calling configure for its actual
location (usually relative), although it will also check ".."
</p>

<p>
Some build setups use multiple configure scripts in subdirectories.
This isn't desirable by default, as it's not normally needed, and
calling find may take a little while.  Passing --ro-recurse as an
option causes it to scan subdirectories, and massage all found configure
scripts before calling the top level one.
</p>

<p></p>


<h4>ro-hosts</h4>

<p>This is an optional file which is not provided and can be created by the
user himself.  It can contain one or more hostnames (on one line) which can be
used to do distributed builds using &quot;distcc&quot;.</p>

<p>To enable the distributed build feature you need the environment variable
&quot;RO_DIST&quot; set to &quot;yes&quot; at ro-config and ro-make time.</p>

<hr>

<h4>Simple use</h4>

<p>(on Debian)</p>

<pre>
apt-get source wget
cd wget-1.8.2
GCCSDK_ENV/ro-config
GCCSDK_ENV/ro-make
</pre>



<p>
This is typical simple use.  You can pass any additional configure commands
to ro-config.  If it was a library, you could now run "make install".
</p>

<p></p>


<hr>

<h4>Problems</h4>

<p>What's important to note about these tools is that they aren't clever -
they are a substitute for lots of manual effort, but not for experience
in programming and porting.  Don't forget to rely on your own judgement.
</p>

<p>If it all possible, we try to avoid patching the original source.  we
instead try to improve our tools, as this is generally a better solution
all round.   This isn't always possible, however, and it's common
for the configure script to need some additional manual changes.
</p>

<p>
Some build systems can get a bit unstuck at being cross compiled.
The typical problem is compiling a program, then expecting it to
work, to generate parts of the build.  The usual solution is a
manual compile for the native system, or change to the makefile.
</p>

<p>
Having INSTALL explicitly set occasionally causes problems, when
the build would have otherwise defaulted to 'cp' and been fine, as
flags 'install' doesn't understand are passed.
</p>

<p>
Having the native version of a config script (e.g. esd-config) and
not having a RISC OS version can cause configure to make unfounded
assumptions when it locates the native config script.
</p>

<p></p>


<hr>

<h4>X11 and xmkmf/imake</h4>

<p>Build systems using xmkmf and imake will generally work too, using
the installed XFree under GCCSDK_ENV and a version of xmkmf
generated by the XFree build for RISC OS.</p>

<p></p>


<hr>

<h4>libtool</h4>

<p>ro-config contains the correct sed magic to process the output
of libfile to extract symbols correctly.   This means that RISC OS
can correctly work with libtool's simulated dynamic linking (e.g.
kaffe) by statically linking.  There should be no extra work
required on your part.</p>

<p></p>


<hr>

<h4>Alternate Paths</h4>

<p>Because of the GCCSDK development, you might have multiple
installations of the cross compiler itself.  You can set
the environment variable GCCSDK_INSTALL_CROSSBIN to point at an
alternate path.
The default value for this build is GCCSDK_BIN.</p>


<p></p>


<hr>

<h4>Autobuilder</h4>

<p>The GCCSDK Autobuilder makes extensive used of these scripts -
you may like to experiment with this to see use of them in practice.</p>
