The RISC OS Software Development Kit [GCCSDK 4.x Release y]
===========================================================

This is a lightweight build environment which combines a GCC 4.x release,
binutils 2.17 release and UnixLib 5.0 into one directory which can
be used to build a RISC OS cross-compiler with target arm-elf-riscos.

Steps:
~~~~~

The setup-gccsdk-params file contains several definitions as environment
variables which you can change if desired.

1. Place a GCC 4.x release in $GCCSDK_GCCORIG
2. Place a binutils 2.17 release in $GCCSDK_BINUTILSORIG
3. Combine the contents of $GCCSDK_GCCORIG, $GCCSDK_BINUTILSORIG and
   UnixLib 5.0 (GAS assembler syntax and ELF configuration) into
   $GCCSDK_SRCDIR and apply the necessary patches for arm-elf-riscos
   target by running:

   ./create-gccsdk

4. Build and install the cross-compiler into $PREFIX:

   ./build-it > build-output.txt 2>&1

   When the configuration has been successfully done during ./build-it,
   you can restart the build by:

   cd arm-elf-riscos
   make
   make install

GCCSDK specific changes for the gcc/binutils sources are done via patches
(recipe/patches directory), copying full source files (recipe/files) or via
scripts (recipe/scripts).  Easy patch (re)creation can be done using the
./create-patch script.  Currently UnixLib 5.0 is copied into $GCCSDK_SRCDIR
using a conversion of an AOF based UnixLib in the GCCSDK 3.4.6 tree to
an ELF one.

The initial arm-elf-riscos work for GCC 4.1 was done by Nick Burrett (Jun
2005). Integrating Nick's work in a GCCSDK build environment and bringing it
up-to-date was done by John Tytgat and John-Mark Bell (Oct 2006).
