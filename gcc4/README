The RISC OS Software Development Kit [GCCSDK GCC 4.1.1 Release 2]
====================================

This is a lightweight build environment which combines a GCC 4.1.1 release,
binutils 2.17 release, UnixLib 5.0 and libscl 2.0 into one directory which can
be used to build a RISC OS cross-compiler and native RISC OS compiler with
target 'arm-unknown-riscos'.

We don't have the GCC and binutils sources stored in our SVN server so you need
to get those sources from their official repositories (see paragraph 2.1.,
point 1 how you can do that easily).  Only patches to those sources and full
copies of new files are stored in the gccsdk SVN repository.

We expect that the current set of GCCSDK patches for GCC and binutils can
be applied to later versions than GCC 4.1.1 and binutils 2.17 as is, or at
least with a minimum of changes of those patches.  However this still needs to
be verified if that's really going to be the case as we're currently focusing
to get all GCCSDK specific development done for GCC 4.1.1 and binutils 2.17.


0. Required build tools
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following is a non exhaustive list of programs which are needed to compile
and work with GCCSDK on top of a typical recent standard Unix distribution:

- automake v1.9.x (*no* other version than the latest in the 1.9.x series which
  is currently 1.9.6, Debian package 'automake1.9')
- autoconf v2.59 (*no* other version, Debian package 'autoconf2.59')
- autogen v5.5.4 (or later)
- svn v1.2 or later (only to be used to checkout GCCSDK source code from
  svn.riscos.info Subversion server)
- gcc & g++ v3.4.x or v4.x (other versions might work too)
- make v3.81 (other versions might work too)
- libtool v1.5.22 (other versions might work too)
- patch v2.5.9 (other versions might work too)
- makeinfo v4.8 (other versions might work too, Debian package 'texinfo')

When you want to build Ada:

- gcc and g++ need to be version 4.1.
- GMP library (Debian package 'libgmp3-dev')
- MPFR library (Debian package 'libmpfr-dev')
- GNAT 4.1 (Debian package 'gnat-4.1')

When you want to run the gcc testsuite, you need at least:

- DejaGnu
- Tcl
- Expect

Other and more detailed prerequisites for building GCC can be found at
<URL:http://gcc.gnu.org/install/prerequisites.html>.


1. Checking out
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To check out GCCSDK 4 build code:

  $ mkdir gccsdk4
  $ cd gccsdk4
  $ svn co svn://svn.riscos.info/gccsdk/trunk/gcc4

We have now in 'gcc4' directory the GCCSDK 4 code.


2. Build and using cross compiler
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

From inside the 'gcc4' directory run:

  $ ./build-world

Follow the prompts as required, and rerun as noted when you are happy
with the settings written to the file 'gccsdk-params'.  If 'build-world'
completes ok, then you will have completed build of the cross compiler and
porting tools, and you can jump straight to step 3 "Using the cross compiler".

2.1. Build setup
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

What follows documents the more involved manual build prodecure. This
might be required if you have problems with the build and need to 
debug issues. It is also relevant if you want to make improvements 
to GCCSDK.

Currently it is probably necessary to define LTCONFIG_VERSION as:

  $ export LTCONFIG_VERSION=1.4a-GCC3.0

It has also proven helpful to define WANT_AUTOMAKE on cygwin as:

  $ export WANT_AUTOMAKE=1.9

Note that if you have an up-to-date file 'gccsdk-params', you can simply do:

  $ source gccsdk-params

which not only defines LTCONFIG_VERSION but also GCCSDK_INSTALL_CROSSBIN
and GCCSDK_INSTALL_ENV which will be needed later on.

The build steps are the following:

1. Build cross-compiler.
2. Build the porting tools.

People only interested in having the cross-compiler only need to do step 1
and they might also be interested in the porting tools as well which ease
porting existing programs using the cross-compiler.  Note that in order to
use Autobuilder, you need to have the porting tools built.

Building the native RISC OS compiler is very similar to building the
cross-compiler and more details can be found in "4. Build the native RISC OS
compiler" section.

2.2. Build cross-compiler
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The 'setup-gccsdk-params' file contains several definitions as environment
variables which aren't supposed to be changed.  Like with GCCSDK 3.4.6, we
recommend setting up $GCCSDK_INSTALL_CROSSBIN which then can be used by
'setup-gccsdk-params' files to determine where the cross-compiler will be
installed during 'make install' (note: $GCCSDK_INSTALL_CROSSBIN actually
specifies the pathname 'bin' subdirectory of the directory where the complete
cross-compiler will be installed).  GCCSDK_INSTALL_CROSSBIN is usually defined
by the user file 'gccsdk-params' which you can simply source in your shell.

1. As the GCC and binutils sources are not in SVN, you need a copy of those.
   Place an official GCC 4.1 release in 'orig.gcc' directory and official
   binutils 2.17 release in 'orig.binutils' by running:

     $ ./download-gcc-binutils gcc
     $ ./download-gcc-binutils binutils

   You only need to do this once as the contents of 'orig.gcc' and
   'orig.binutils' is considered read-only from now on and used in the scripts
   'create-srcdir' (see step 3) and 'create-patch' (to update or create
   patches).

2. Combine the contents of 'orig.gcc', parts of 'orig.binutils', UnixLib 5.0
   and libscl 2.0 support into 'srcdir' directory, do the configuration and
   apply the necessary patches for the arm-unknown-riscos target by running:

     $ ./create-srcdir

   At this point the source tree at 'srcdir' is used to do the real build.

3. Build and install the cross-compiler into $GCCSDK_INSTALL_CROSSBIN/..
   directory:

     $ ./build-it > build-output.txt 2>&1

   Note that 'build-it' can take some useful options, use -h option to have an
   option list.

   The 'build-it' script does roughly the following:

   1. Run 'configure' which will check the build systems for availability of
      prerequisites and figure out the build options to use.  This configure
      step will be done in several subdirectories of gcc/binutils/libunixlib/
      ...
   2. Run 'make'
   3. Run 'make install' to install the successful built binaries
   4. Move to 'srcdir/riscos' and call a similar named 'build-it' script to
      build the RISC OS specific binaries.

   When the configuration part has been successfully done during ./build-it,
   you can restart the gcc/binutils/libunixlib/libscl specific build parts by:

     $ cd builddir-cross
     $ make
     $ make install

   Instead of restarting the build with 'make' at the top-level, you can also
   restart parts of the build by going to the appropriate subdirectory inside
   builddir-cross and do 'make' followed by 'make install' there.  E.g. for
   rebuilding libunixlib:

     $ cd builddir-cross/arm-unknown-riscos/libunixlib
     $ make
     $ make install

   When you want specific compiler options for target libraries, you can
   specify them like (e.g. taking the options "-O3 -march=armv4"):

     $ cd builddir-cross
     $ make CFLAGS_FOR_TARGET="-O3 -march=armv4" CXXFLAGS_FOR_TARGET="-O3 -march=armv4"
     $ make install

2.3. Build porting tools
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The files in the subdirectory 'porting-scripts' can help you to easily use the
cross-compiler for porting of existing programs.  More information can be
found in the 'PortingTools.html' file how this works.

To install those scripts (This will have already been done in step 1.1):

  1. Define GCCSDK_INSTALL_ENV as the directory where those porting scripts can
     be installed.  E.g.:

       $ export GCCSDK_INSTALL_ENV=/home/riscos/env

     GCCSDK_INSTALL_CROSSBIN still needs to be defined where the cross-compiler
     has been instaled (see above).

  2. Run 'install-env':

       $ ./install-env

Note that the GCCSDK Autobuilder framework will use these porting-scripts in
order to do its job, cfr. <URL:http://www.riscos.info/index.php/Using_GCCSDK>
for more information.


3. Using the cross-compiler
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The cross-compiler can be used on its own.  The recommended way is to
define the environment variable GCCSDK_INSTALL_CROSSBIN.
  $ export GCCSDK_INSTALL_CROSSBIN=/home/riscos/cross/bin

Add add this environment value to your PATH.
  $ PATH=$GCCSDK_INSTALL_CROSSBIN:$PATH

Then use it as you would the GCC compiler normally.

GCCSDK_INSTALL_CROSSBIN is sometimes also used explicitly to access the
GCCSDK cross-compiler.

3.1. RISC OS filename compatibility issues for the cross-compiler
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Since the cross-compiler is built to execute on a Unix-like file system,
it expects file naming conventions particular to that operating system.
However, since there is going to be a lot of source code out there that
makes use of some RISC OS pathname features, the pre-processor has been
fixed to cope with path variable names in file names.

When the pre-processor attempts to read an include statement like:

  #include <DeskLib:Wimp.h>

it will try to resolve the DeskLib reference against the environment variable
DESKLIB_PATH.  So you could install the DeskLib header files in a place
such as /home/riscos/env/include/DeskLib.  To get GCC to search in that
directory for those headers, simply define the variable:

  $ export DESKLIB_PATH=/home/riscos/env/include/DeskLib

The xxx_PATH environment variable is in fact a search path containing one
or more directories separated by a comma where the part after "xxx:" in
the #include line is being searched for.

3.2. Throwback
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When used in conjuction with the SysLogD module, the cross-compiler can
produce throwback messages on a RISC OS machine when cross-compiling on
a different machine. This allows you to edit in RISC OS files stored on
a network filing system, cross-compile, and get throwback as if the
compiler was running on the RISC OS machine. It can also be used if the
cross-compiler is invoked by distcc.

To use throwback:

- On RISC OS install the SysLogD module and set up a mappings file as
  described in its help file (see riscos/syslogd/ReadMe).
- On the machine running the cross-compiler, set the THROWBACK_HOST
  environment variable to the hostname or IP address of the RISC OS machine.
  Add -mthrowback to the compiler command line.


4. Build the native RISC OS compiler
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The native RISC OS compiler and associated programs like the ELF loader (part
of !SharedLibs) are built using the previously built cross-compiler.  It is
using the same 'build-it' script with "riscos" instead of "cross" as argument.
The intermediate build results are stored in 'builddir-riscos' instead of
'builddir-cross'.

   $ ./build-it riscos > build-output.txt 2>&1

Note that 'build-it' can take some useful options, use -h option to have an
option list.

If you want to restart the native RISC OS compiler build, you need to ensure
that the cross-compiler can be found in your path, so you can do:

   $ PATH=$GCCSDK_INSTALL_CROSSBIN:$PATH

The RISC OS GCC release consists of several kits.  These are prepared using:

   $ ./create-gcckit

And you can find the result in the 'release-area' subdirectory.  The directory
and file structure there are exactly what will be packaged in a couple of zip
files.  This packaging in zip files happens by:

   $ ./create-gcckit -pkg


5. Developing GCCSDK
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Developer changes can and should first be done in 'srcdir' directory and you
can then rebuild parts of GCCSDK by going to the appropriate subdirectory
inside 'builddir-cross' (or 'builddir-riscos' if your changes are appropriate
for the native RISC OS compiler) and issue a 'make' or 'make install' there.

Autotools configuration files changes need to be made in the files
configure.ac and Makefile.am or when those are not yet existing, in the
configure.in and Makefile.in files instead.  The already existing 'Makefile'
will detect those autotool configuration file changes and normally
automatically regenerates all related files but as this is not happening when
doing a full build from scratch (e.g. after 'create-srcdir'), we're doing a
forced Autotools regeneration of some parts of GCCSDK using scripts inside
the recipe/scripts directory which are executed at the end of 'create-srcdir'.

When those changes are ready to be commited, either patches need to be created
(in recipe/patches directory) or either full file copy needs to be made (in
recipe/files directory).

Easy patch (re)creation can be done using the 'create-patch' script. This
script will also take care of making full copies inside recipe/files directory
when it concerns a file not belonging to GCC nor binutils standard
distribution.

  $ cd srcdir
  $ ../create-patch <file to patch or file to copy>

Don't forget to do a 'svn add recipe/...' when it concerns a new patch file or
a new file inside recipe/files or recipe/scripts.


6. Testing
~~~~~~~~~~

After building the cross-compiler you can run the GCC testsuite.  This can be
easily done under Linux using its binfmt_misc kernel module and QEMU
containing RISC OS specific changes
(cfr. <URL:http://www.riscos.info/index.php/QEMU>) as those together allow
you to run unmodified ELF RISC OS binaries under Linux.

The GCC testsuite requires the installation of at least DejaGnu, Tcl and
Expect and can be started using:

  $ cd builddir-cross/gcc
  $ make check-gcc//unix/{-static}

Currently the testing works only for static libraries so that why you need to
specify the '-static' option. When you want to test the hard-float
configuration use:

  $ make check-gcc//unix/{-static -mhard-float}

Or both at the same time:

  $ make check-gcc//unix/{-static -mhard-float,-static -msoft-float}

More information on running GCC testsuite can be found at
<URL:http://gcc.gnu.org/install/test.html>.


7. RISC OS Packaging Project packages
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A set of packages suitable for use with the RISC OS Packaging Project
can be created by running:

  $ ./create-riscpkg

from the gcc4 directory after running the create-gcckit script documented
above.

The packages are output to release-area/riscpkg.

The 'zip' tool is required to be present in $GCCSDK_INSTALL_ENV/bin to run
this script.

The compilers and base GCC use the version numbers of the GCCSDK, however
the support modules, shared library loader, C and C++ shared libraries
need their versions set by editing the riscpkg-versions script.

More information on the RISC OS Packaging Project can be found at
<URL:http://www.riscpkg.org>.


8. Credits
~~~~~~~~~~

The initial static ELF RISC OS work for GCC 4.1 was done by Nick Burrett (Jun
2005). Integrating Nick's work in a GCCSDK build environment and bringing it
up-to-date was done by John Tytgat and John-Mark Bell (Oct 2006).

Module support, multilib, libscl integration and build support changes was
realised by John Tytgat.

Lee Noar contributed his RISC OS ELF loader work together with the necessary
dynamic ELF changes for RISC OS (originally developed for GCCSDK 3.4)
(Oct 2006).

Peter Naulls wrote the Autobuilder and Porting tools, and contributed
most of the ports in the Autobuilder.

The riscos.info Wiki is run by Peter Naulls and John Tytgat, and credit for
additional GCCSDK information also goes to Theo Markettos and Adam Richardson.

All of the work in GCC 4.1 for RISC OS would never have been possible without
important contributions from many people in the original GCC 3.x GCCSDK;
in particular, endless improvements to UnixLib which made it practical to
run a wide range of software on RISC OS.  See those versions for full details.
