	* armeabi-support.h(armeabi_memory_free): In retrospect, trying
	to force the existing API to be more mmap like is not a good idea.
	This would require significant changes to SOManager, possibly adding
	bugs whereas, as it stands, it is stable. A better idea is to
	add a new allocator type.

	* armeabi-support.h(armeabi_memory_free): Add a size argument.
	Not used by the current version, but a future one will.
	* Makefile.am: Install the header into GCCSDK_INSTALL_ENV/include
	for general use by other libraries.

	* Initial revision:
	Module to provide support services to code generated by
	GCC 8 and above. Services provided (via SWI) are:
	Memory allocation via mapped memory pages.
	Stack management.
	Abort handling (used primarily by the stack handler).
