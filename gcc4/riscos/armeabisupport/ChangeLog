	* memory.c(allocator_munmap): Fix zero pain; check that there is a last block
	before trying to use it to set the DA size.
	* shm.c: White space (indenting) change.
	* configure.ac: Bump version to v1.05.

Tue Dec 21 13:21:51 GMT 2021  Lee Noar  <lee.noar@sky.com>

	* mmap-asm.s: Some additional comments.
	* shm.c: Add dup op to shm. This simply increases the ref count and
	returns the same handle. The standard states that dup() will return
	the lowest fd, but that isn't possible here. However, as that is usually
	used to redirect stdout/stderr to another file, it shouldn't be an issue
	with shared memory.
	Start the ref count from 1 rather than 2, now that dup() is catered for.
	* configure.ac: Bump version to v1.04.

Tue Jun 15 19:49:50 BST 2021  Lee Noar  <lee.noar@sky.com>

	* types.h: Add a list of shared memory objects to the global variables.
	* decl-asm.h: As above.
	* shm.{c/h}: Add shared memory implementation.
	* mmap.c(armeabi_mmap): Check fd for shared memory object and store the
	allocation in the shared memory.
	* memory.{c/h}(allocator_munmap_block): New function to unmap a known
	block.
	(allocator_munmap): Check fd for a shared memory object and deref.
	* main.c: Cleanup shared memory objects on program exit.
	* command.c: Dump list of shared memory objects.
	* configure.ac: Bump version to 1.03.
	* Makefile.am: Build shm.c.
	* swihandler.c: Handle SHMOP SWI.
	* armeabisupport.cmhg: Add SHMOP SWI. Add errno style errors that should
	make it easier to map to errno in Unixlib.

Thu Apr 1  17:34:49 BST 2021  Lee Noar  <lee.noar@sky.com>

	* types.h(dynamicarea_block): Store the size of the DA in pages
	rather than the end address.
	Move some type declarations from memory.h to here.
	Define separate objects for each allocator type derived from
	a base type so that each type only holds data relevant to
	itself.
	* swihandler.c: Handle new mmap SWI.
	* armeabisupport.cmhg: Add new mmap SWI and a new error.
	* swi.c(dynamic_area_create): Handle new mmap allocator type.
	Follow change to dynamicarea_block above where the size in pages is stored.
	* swi-asm.{s/h}(get_os_permissions,get_access_permissions): New
	swi veneers for OSMemory 17 & 18.
	* stack.h: Reduce maximum size of stack dynamic area from 512MB to 256MB.
	The former may have been a bit excessive.
	* stack.c: Variable name change size->page_count.
	Use a dedicated data block for the stack abort handler rather than
	piggy backing onto the main abort data block.
	* stack-asm.s: Make use of dedicated data block passed in r12.
	Abort handler can now return an error code that Unixlib can query.
	* mmap.{c/h},mmap-asm.s: mmap SWI implementation for use by Unixlib.
	mmap, munmap and madvise are the main targets, mprotect needs more work.
	File mapping relies on Unixlib to load the file as before.
	Implemented as a pool of mmap allocators (dynamic area) each of which
	can be upto 100MB in size.
	* memory.{c/h}: Add a virtual function table to allocators.
	Add new mmap allocator type.
	* main.c: Register/deregister mmap & stack abort handlers.
	* init-fini.c: Cash the OS memory page permission values.
	* decl-asm.h: Update ASM structures to match C structures.
	* configure.ac: Bump version to 1.02.
	* command.c: Dump mmap allocations with the info command.
	* armeabi-support.h: Add SWI veneers.
	* abort.{c/h}: New reason code to allow error status to be read.
	struct abort_block: Remove stack abort handler specific members, add
	error status member.
	* abort-asm.s: Abort handlers can return an error code.
	* Makefile.am: Add new files to build.

Fri Mar 20 19:27:48 GMT 2020  Lee Noar  <lee.noar@sky.com>

	* armeabi-support.h(armeabi_memory_free): Failed to remove size
	register in previous commit.

Thu Mar 19 14:43:28 GMT 2020  Lee Noar  <lee.noar@sky.com>

	* armeabi-support.h(armeabi_memory_free): In retrospect, trying
	to force the existing API to be more mmap like is not a good idea.
	This would require significant changes to SOManager, possibly adding
	bugs whereas, as it stands, it is stable. A better idea is to
	add a new allocator type.

Wed Mar 18 17:02:07 GMT 2020  Lee Noar  <lee.noar@sky.com>

	* armeabi-support.h(armeabi_memory_free): Add a size argument.
	Not used by the current version, but a future one will.
	* Makefile.am: Install the header into GCCSDK_INSTALL_ENV/include
	for general use by other libraries.

Sat Oct 12 18:27:59 BST 2019  Lee Noar  <lee.noar@sky.com>

	* Initial revision:
	Module to provide support services to code generated by
	GCC 8 and above. Services provided (via SWI) are:
	Memory allocation via mapped memory pages.
	Stack management.
	Abort handling (used primarily by the stack handler).
