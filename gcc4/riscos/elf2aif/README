                             elf2aif
             A static ELF binary to AIF program convertor

Purpose
=======

This program converts a static ELF binary into an AIF binary allowing
to be executed on RISC OS without the need for an ELF loader.

Use:

  $ elf2aif [options] <ELF input file> [ <AIF output file> ]

Options:
  -v, --verbose prints informational messages during processing
      --help    display this help and exit
      --version output version information and exit

When <AIF output file> is not specified, the <ELF input file> gets overwritten
by the produced AIF output file.

Building
========

elf2aif is part of GCCSDK 4 and gets built in that infrastructure.  Its build
is based on GNU's autoconf and automake so if you want to build elf2aif
yourself, basically you can do:

  $ cd <elf2aif project dir>
  $ autoreconf --install
  $ cd <temporary build directory>
  $ <project dir>/configure --prefix=$GCCSDK_INSTALL_CROSSBIN/..
  $ make
  $ make install

To cross-compile: you can reuse the same 'configure' script made by
'autoreconf --install' mentioned above and make sure your PATH environment
variable contains $GCCSDK_INSTALL_CROSSBIN while doing:

  $ cd <temporary cross build directory>
  $ <project dir>/configure --prefix=<result cross build dir> \
     CFLAGS='-O3 -mlibscl' \
     --host=arm-unknown-riscos --target=arm-unknown-riscos
  $ make
  $ make install
