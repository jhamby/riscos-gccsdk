These are very simple examples for C, C++ and module programs.  To compile
them, you need at least 'make' program (separately downloadable at
<URL:http://www.riscos.info/packages/>).

They also show both the use of static and shared ELF libraries but the
latter is not part of GCCSDK GCC 4.1.1 Release 1.
