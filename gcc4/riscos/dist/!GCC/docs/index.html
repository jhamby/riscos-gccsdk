<h2>Welcome to GCCSDK GCC 4.7.4 Release 1 (Development) for RISC&nbsp;OS</h2>
<p>

<p>If you have received this copy of GCC from a CD of fetched your copy from the Internet yourself some time ago, then it is likely there is a more up-to-date version obtainable from <a href="http://gccsdk.riscos.info/">http://gccsdk.riscos.info/</a> which is also the homepage of this RISC&nbsp;OS GCC port.

<h3>1. Introduction</h3>

<p>This is the RISC&nbsp;OS port of <a href="http://gcc.gnu.org/">GCC (GNU Compiler Collection)</a> and supporting binaries allowing you to start developing RISC&nbsp;OS applications and modules straight away. So you get a compiler for one or more languages, an linker, an assembler, a RISC&nbsp;OS module header and veneer generator, the UnixLib C runtime library and headers and stubs for the SharedCLibrary module (as found in the RISC&nbsp;OS ROMs).

<p>This GCC port itself and the code produced using this GCC version is targeted and tested for RISC&nbsp;OS 4 (26-bit and 32-bit version), RISC&nbsp;OS 5 (32-bit version) and RISC&nbsp;OS 6 (26-bit and 32-bit version).

<p>The RISC&nbsp;OS GNU Compiler Collection consists of a generic front end program `gcc' that provides a consistent interface to the compilers themselves. Currently compilers are supported for the C and C++ languages. Later releases of GCCSDK might have support for Ada, Fortran, Java, Pascal and/or Objective C/C++ but this will be largely dependant on available GCCSDK developer resources, interest and of course that all technical issues can be reasonably solved.

<p>The following is a short introduction to GCC. It does not provide an introduction to programming, for that you will have to get a text book on the language you are interested in.

<h4>1.1. Installation</h4>

<p>To install GCC, copy the contents of !GCC onto your hard disc. Other compilers can be installed by copying the contents of their archives into the same directory as where you install GCC - RISC&nbsp;OS will automatically combine the !GCC directories together. Running !GCC will setup Run$Path to automatically search for the compiler tools.

<p>As compilers are installed, sub-directories named according to the language they support will be placed within !GCC.docs. These sub-directories will contain specific information for the language compiler, including its usage and environment requirements.

<p>This completes installation, and GCC may be used simply by typing 'gcc' at the CLI prompt. In order to verify which version of 'gcc' you are using, specify the --version switch:
<pre>
   *gcc --version
</pre>

<h4>1.2. Simple compilations</h4>

<p>The instructions below are generic and the ideas presented can be applied to all GNU compilers. The usage of C source files is merely for example purposes.

<p>Source files are stored in the standard ASCII text format and kept in a directory that is relevant for the language of your program. For example, C programs are stored in directory 'c', C++ programs are stored in 'cc', assembler files in 's' and CMunge/CMHG files in 'cmhg'.

<p>When specifying those source files for the compile, assembler or linker, it is recommended to use the 'my_c_program.c' syntax instead of the RISC&nbsp;OS file syntax 'c.my_c_program'.

<p>For simple use, all that is needed is to set up a command line prompt and ensure there is enough free memory to run the compiler (details of memory requirements vary between compilers and can be found in the specific compiler documentation).

<p>To compile a C program just type:
<pre>
   *gcc hellow.c -o hellow
</pre>

<p>This will compile, assemble and link the source 'c.hellow' in one go to produce an ELF executable (filetype &amp;E1F) called 'hellow'. An
ELF executable can make use of static libraries and/or shared libraries (whom the UnixLib runtime library). By default, the shared libraries
will be used (use link switch -static if you want static libraries to be used).

<p>ELF executables need support of a loader module in order to be usable under RISC OS and this is provided by the
'!SharedLibs' application which containing the SOManager RISC&nbsp;OS module.  This means also that when ELF executables
are distributed to users, they also need to have access to '!SharedLibs' application in order to be able to run
the ELF based program.

<p>It is possible to convert an ELF executable into a standalone AIF binary when the ELF executable is linked when only using
static libraries (i.e. when -static link switch has been used).  This removes the need to distribute the '!SharedLibs'
application together with the produced program but of course defeats the point of using shared libraries.  This is done by running:
<pre>
   *elf2aif hellow
</pre>

<p>When distributing ELF executables you probably want to strip the ELF executables first as well as this will reduce program size by removing all non-essential information.  This is done by adding the switch '-Wl,-s':
<pre>
   *gcc hellow.c -Wl,-s -o hellow
</pre>

<p>It is possible to compile several sources at one go, mixing C sources in the same program, using a command line of:
<pre>
   *gcc file1.c file2.c file3.c file4.c -o myprogram
</pre>

<p>Again, this will compile, assemble and link all the sources to produce the ELF 'myprogram' executable.

<p>To compile to the object form, use the -c switch. i.e.
<pre>
   *gcc -c file.c
</pre>
or
<pre>
   *gcc -c file.c -o file.o
</pre>
<p>will compile and assemble 'c.file' to 'o.file'.

<p>Support has been provided for both RISC&nbsp;OS and UNIX format filenames and we recommend to use the UNIX format style
as this is more cross-platform compatible. For example:
<pre>
   UNIX format (preferred)	RISC OS format

   ../include/stdio.h		^.include.h.stdio
   /work/gcc/hello.c		$.work.gcc.c.hello
   stdlib.h			h.stdlib
</pre>
<p>but note that
<pre>
   tree.def			tree/def
</pre>

<p>For further examples of compilation procedures, please look at <a href="../Examples">`Examples' inside !GCC</a>.

<h4>1.3. More advanced compilations</h4>

<h5>1.3.1. SharedCLibrary</h5>

<p>By default <a href="libunixlib">UnixLib</a> is used as runtime library.  In case it is important to use RISC&nbsp;OS' <a href="SharedCLibrary">SharedCLibrary</a> and at expense of a much more reduced API, you can do that by specifying the switch -mlibscl at compile and link time. The linker will produce an Absolute (filetype &amp;FF8) file having an AIF header straight away instead of producing an ELF executable (filetype &amp;E1F):

<pre>
   *gcc -mlibscl -o file.o -c file.c
   *gcc -mlibscl -o mybinary file.o
</pre>

<h5>1.3.2. RISC&nbsp;OS module support</h5>

<p>When C based modules are created, you can only make use of the SharedCLibrary as runtime library or no runtime library at all.  UnixLib is not suited as runtime library for modules.  When you do not make use of SharedCLibrary in your module you're on your own to implement all your memory management, I/O, etc. (when needed) yourself (possibly using RISC OS' or third party modules' SWIs).

<p><a href="cmunge">CMunge</a> is used to create a RISC&nbsp;OS module header and the necessary setup code for each of the user required module entries, like initialisation, finalisation, service calls, command implementations etc.  It can also be used to create veneer code acting as glue code for RISC&nbsp;OS callbacks into your C<!-- /C++ --> coded module.

<p>At runtime the module will automatically get a private workspace holding internal state data (currently 3 words) but also all non-constant global variables used in your code. Initial non-zero non-constant global variables are stored in the module code itself and those get copied at startup in the module's private workspace where they can change during runtime.  Initial zero global variables are not part of the module code but get a place in the private workspace as well.  Constant global variables remain in the module and are not copied to the private workspace.

<h6>1.3.2.1. CMunge</h6>

The requirements for CMunge are formulated in a .cmhg file which gets parsed by 'cmunge' to create an ELF object file and a header file.  The generated header file contains all C prototypes of the user supplied routines used by the routines in the generated ELF object file.

<p>Typically this is done by:

<pre>
  *cmunge -tgcc -32bit -d modheader.h module.cmhg
  *cmunge -tgcc -32bit -o modheader.o module.cmhg
</pre>

<p>The generated modheader.h header file is included by all C code implementing the C functions specified in given .cmhg file.

<p>See <a href="cmunge">CMunge documentation</a> for more information.  

<h6>1.3.2.2. Module support with SharedCLibrary</h6>

<p>For all C compilations and final linking the switch -mmodule needs to be specified.  For compiling this is required to make sure that global data can be properly relocated at runtime.  For linking this will make sure the output is a valid RISC&nbsp;OS module containing the necessary relocations needed at start up time.

<p>Specifying -mmodule implicitly specifies -mlibscl so it is not really necessary to specify it yourself. However if you want your build script (or Makefile) to be backwards compatible with GCCSDK 3.4 you have to specify -mlibscl as well as it was not done by default before.

<p>In this example 'modheader.o' is already generated by CMunge before.

<pre>
   *gcc -mlibscl -mmodule -O2 -c module.c -o module.o
   *gcc -mlibscl -mmodule module.o modheader.o -o mymodule
</pre>

<p>Module code executed in SVC or IRQ mode does not need to do any APCS stack checking (as the RISC&nbsp;OS R13 SVC and IRQ stacks are not chunked) so the switch -mmodule implicitly selects the
-mno-apcs-stack-check switch as well. However some pieces of module code can also run in USR mode as e.g. module start code (hence, as application) so the -mapcs-stack-check switch is then exclicitly needed
to enforce chunk stack checking for those module object files containing code which is executed in USR mode.

<h6>1.3.2.3. Module support without SharedCLibrary</h6>

<p>Modules created without using SharedCLibrary have the advantage to not be dependent on the SharedCLibrary and have typically a smaller footprint.  They are created by specifying the extra CMunge switch "-znoscl" (specifying not to generate code to interface with SharedCLibrary but generate code instead to setup the runtime stack itself) and by the extra linker switches "-nostdlib -lgcc" (specifying not to use any standard library, whom the SharedCLibrary, except the GCC library which contains helper routines possibly used by its generated code).

<p>Note you can still include the standard headers (like stdbool.h, limits.h, stdlib.h, etc) to get some useful type definitions or constants but that does not mean you can make use of any of the functions with their prototypes being defined there.  If you want to avoid including any of the standard headers (for whatever reason), you can specify the extra compile switch "-nostdinc".

<p>It might be that GCC generates code which contains memcmp, memset, memcpy and memmove calls.  In such a case you need to provide those routines yourself (they are the same routines as the ones defined in standard C).

<p>Calling RISC&nbsp;OS SWIs can be done via inline assembler calls, custom assembler routines or making use of a C library providing SWI level access like <a href="http://ro-oslib.sourceforge.net/">OSLib</a>.  Note that such libraries can not use the SharedCLibrary as well.

<h6>1.3.2.4. Module resource data</h6>

<p>Modules often have their data (Messages, Sprites, etc) stored in ResourceFS. <a href="mkresfs">mkresfs</a> can be used to create a C file representing the intended ResourceFS data allowing easy (de)registration with ResourceFS. In GCCSDK 3.4 this functionality was covered with the 'resgen' program but as its code was very tightly AOF based, a new program (and approach) was chosen.

<h5>1.3.3. Static UnixLib</h5>

<p>When UnixLib is selected as runtime library, by default it will be the shared UnixLib library.  It is possible to use the static UnixLib at link time by specifying the linker switch -static.

<pre>
   *gcc -o file.o -c file.c
   *gcc -static -o mybinary file.o
</pre>

<h5>1.3.4. Profiling (experimental)</h5>

<p>Profiling is the art of determining where the CPU spends most of its time when running your program. To enable profiling, the option -pg is passed to GCC during compiling and linking. An example, <a href="../../Examples/C/c/collatz">collatz.c</a> should help to make this clearer:

<pre>
   *gcc -pg -o collatz collatz.c
</pre>

<p>Now, when ever the program is run, it will be profiled and upon exiting will write a file named gmon/out to the currently selected directory. This is a machine readable file and must be processed by a program called gprof before the results can be made sense of. The simplist way to do this is to pass the executable and the gmon/out file to gprof on the command line:

<pre>
   *gprof collatz gmon/out >gprof-output
</pre>

Note that the output of the command is written to a file, as the output from gprof contains formfeed characters (ASCII char 12) which cause unwanted effects when printed directly to the screen.
For an explanation of the gprof results, please see the <a href="gprof/index.html">gprof manual</a>.

<p>Optimising code (that is, using the -O switch when compiling) can effect how the code is profiled, for example, functions can apparently disappear and fail to be listed in the profiling results. This is most likely due to GCC inlining the function so that it does not exist as a function is its own right but becomes part of another function. One way around this is to tell GCC not to inline such functions by using:

<pre>
   __attribute__ ((noinline))
</pre>

when declaring them.

<p>It's possible to control manually what is and isn't profiled by using the moncontrol function, which is declared in the system header file &lt;sys/gmon.h&gt;. The value passed as the single argument to moncontrol should be 0 to stop profiling and 1 to start profiling, for example, if you have a function a() which calls b(), but you don't want b() to be profiled, then it may look like this:

<pre>
   void b(void)
   {
     ...
   }

   void a(void)
   {
     ...
     moncontrol(0);
     b();
     moncontrol(1);
     ...
   }
</pre>

<h5>1.3.4.1. Profiling - System requirements</h5>

<p>Profiling support requires at least an ARM 600 and RISC&nbsp;OS 4. As only HAL and OS calls are used, it should work on any version of RISC OS with a HAL. For a 26 bit OS, the HAL26 module written by Theo Markettos is required.

<p>Due to the low level nature of the profiling support, this feature is currently deemed experimental, as it is difficult to gauge how it will interact with other programs. It's therefore advisable to save any important work before using the profiler. You should not attempt to profile two programs at the same time, as this will almost certainly fail (a future version may infact take steps to prevent it).

<h5>1.3.4.2. Profiling - Shared libraries</h5>

<p>Support for profiling shared libraries is not yet implemented (although we hope to add this in the future), however, this does not prevent the dynamically linked program from being profiled. You should remember though that any functions within shared libraries will not count towards the profile.

<h5>1.3.4.3. Profiling - How it works</h5>

<p>Profiling in RISC OS GCCSDK involves two techniques; counting functions calls, recording the relationships between each of them and recording how much time is spent in each.

Compiling with -pg has the effect of inserting a function call to mcount at the beginning of every function. mcount is provided by UnixLib (which therefore must be the runtime library), and is responsible for incrementing a count for the current function and recording its caller.

<p>When linking, the use of -pg causes GCC to link against gcrt1-riscos.o instead of crt1-riscos.o. This tells UnixLib that profiling has been enabled and that it should start the profiling hardware timer. The hardware timer is set to generate an interrupt one hundred times every second. Upon each interrupt, the program being profiled is stopped and a small (interrupt) routine is called with the address at which the program stopped passed to it. The interrupt routine increments a counter for this particular address and then returns control back to the point of the interruption and the program continues as if nothing happened.
This is called statistical sampling.
The counters for each sample point are 16 bits wide which means that each can count to 65535 before overflow occurs. If an overflow of any of the samples is detected, profiling is automatically disabled, however, the result file is still written.

<h4>1.4. Switches</h4>

<p>This is a list of the simpler, standard switches for GCC. Full details can be obtained from the <a href="gcc/gcc/index.html">GNU C/C++ manual</a>. Please see below for the ARM specific switches since these have altered from the original GCC version.

<h5>1.4.1. General switches</h5>

<p>The switches described below are useable with any GNU compiler.

<dl>
<dt>-c
  <dd>Compile and assemble the source to the object file
<dt>-S
  <dd>Compile the source to assembler code
<dt>-E
  <dd>Pre-process the source file
<dt>-o &lt;file&gt;
  <dd>Put the resulting output into &lt;file&gt;
<dt>-O
  <dd>Apply some optimizations to the output
<dt>-O2
  <dd>Apply full optimization.
<dt>-O3
  <dd>Full optimization and inline small functions as well.
<dt>-static
  <dd>Use static instead of shared UnixLib runtime library.  This switch is implicitly implied when the SharedCLibrary runtime library is used (by using -mlibscl or -mmodule switches).
</dl>

<h5>1.4.2. ARM specific switches</h5>

<p>The ARM specific switches are documented in <a href="gcc/gcc/index.html">GNU C/C++ manual</a>, section "ARM Options".  The most important ones are:

<dl>
<dt>-mpoke-function-name (default) / -mno-poke-function-name
  <dd>Place the name of the current function before the start of the function to allow the post mortem debugger to print a readable backtrace.
    <p>Turning this switch on can increase code size by about 3.5% for C programs and as much as 10% for C++. However, it should be noted that the performance of the generated application will not be slower. It is useful to turn this switch on when developing applications as it can lead to a clear indication of where a program is failing when a backtrace is generated.
<dt>-msoft-float (default for when UnixLib runtime library is used)
  <dd>Select soft-float routines to be used and generated when floating point operations are needed. Unless you have hardware FP support in your ARM processor, soft-float routines result in faster executables.
<dt>-mhard-float (default when SharedCLibrary runtime library is used)
  <dd>Makes that floating point (FP) ARM instructions will be used in the generated code.
</dl>

<p>The -msoft-float and -mhard-float switches are mutually exclusive.

<h5>1.4.3. RISC&nbsp;OS specific switches</h5>

<dl>
<dt>-mthrowback / -mno-throwback (default)
<dd>Send errors to a text editor capable of receiving 'throwbacks'. Error throwbacks will only occur when the DDEUtils module has previously been loaded.
<dt>-munixlib (default)
<dd>Builds and links source code against the UnixLib headers and library files. Note that when used, this needs to be specified during compiling and linking. This defines the preprocessor define __TARGET_UNIXLIB__.
<dt>-mlibscl
<dd>Builds and links source code against the SharedCLibrary headers and library files. Note that when used, this needs to be specified during compiling and linking. This defines the preprocessor define __TARGET_SCL__.
    <p>Switch -mmodule will implicitly select -mlibscl as well.
<dt>-mmodule
<dd>Generates code suitable for a RISC&nbsp;OS module.  This will implicitly select -mlibscl.  This also defines the preprocessor define __TARGET_MODULE__.
</dl>

<p>The -munixlib and -mlibscl switches are mutually exclusive.

<h5>1.4.4. Obsolete or not implemented GCCSDK specific switches</h5>

<dl>
<dt>-mapcs-26 / -mapcs-32
<dd>From GCCSDK 3.3.3 release onwards, APCS-32 became default and APCS-R deprecated. With the releases before you could select between those two ABI's using respectively the mutually exclusive -mapcs-32 and -mapcs-26 switches.
    <p>From GCCSDK 4 onwards we don't have any APCS-R support and made the switches -mapcs-32 and -mapcs-26 obsolete.
<dt>-mamu
<dd>Generates the file !Depend which contains a list of all the source files that the produced object depends on. This is intended for use with Acorn's Make Utility (AMU), which edits the makefile to include these after the '# Dynamic Dependencies' line.
    <p>The use of GNU make is preferred as it allows to write more expressive Makefiles and ensures a better compatibility with or require less differences than Makefiles for cross-compiling.
<dt>-mclient-static-data-offset (default)
<dd>Only relevant when compiling a RISC&nbsp;OS module (switch -mmodule set). This specifies to use the client static data offset (at sl-536) instead of the library static data offset (sl-540).
    <p>The -mclient-static-data-offset and -mlibrary-static-data-offset switches are mutually exclusive.
<dt>-mlibrary-static-data-offset
<dd>Only relevant when compiling a RISC&nbsp;OS module (switch -mmodule set). This specifies to use the library static data offset (at sl-540) instead of the client static data offset (sl-536).  This is only to be used in very rare cases.
    <p>The -mclient-static-data-offset and -mlibrary-static-data-offset switches are mutually exclusive.
</dl>

<h4>1.5. Binary configurations</h4>

<p>As an overview, the following configurations are possible with the native RISC&nbsp;OS release :

<ul>
  <li>Softfloat with shared UnixLib as runtime library: default configuration.
  <li>Softfloat with static UnixLib as runtime library: use '-static' switch when linking.
  <li>Hardfloat with SharedCLibrary as runtime library: use '-mlibscl' when compiling and '-mlibscl' when linking. When creating a RISC&nbsp;OS module you specify '-mmodule' instead for both complication and linking.
</ul>

<h4>1.6. Predefines</h4>

<p>This is a short list of the most interesting and useful predefines set:

<dl>
<dt>__arm__
<dd>Always defined in the RISC&nbsp;OS port and can be used to make a difference between ARM specific vs non-ARM code.
<dt>__riscos
<dt>__riscos__
<dd>Always defined in the RISC&nbsp;OS port and can be used to make a difference between RISC&nbsp;OS specific vs non-RISC&nbsp;OS code.
<dt>__ELF__
<dd>Always defined as GCCSDK 4 is now ELF based.
<dt>__SOFTFP__
<dd>Defined when soft-float routines are used in the to be generated code in contrast with using floating point (FP) instructions. FP instructions will be used when the SharedCLibrary runtime library is selected (switch -mlibscl and/or -mmodule is selected).  When UnixLib runtime library is used, by default soft-float routines are used unless you have -mhard-float specified.
<dt>__TARGET_SCL__
<dd>Defined when targeting the SharedCLibrary runtime library, i.e. when -mlibscl or -mmodule switches are supplied.
<dt>__TARGET_MODULE__
<dd>Defined when module code is being generated, i.e. when -mmodule switch is supplied.
<dt>__TARGET_UNIXLIB__
<dd>Defined when targeting the UnixLib runtime library, i.e. when -mlibscl nor -mmodule switches are supplied (as -munixlib is default switch).
</dl>

<p>GCCSDK 3 defines the predefine __aof__ which is no longer the case in GCCSDK 4 as it is now fully ELF based. So this can be used to distinguish between AOF and ELF compilations.

<p>GCCSDK 3 also defines __arm (together with __arm__) while GCCSDK 4 only defines __arm__.

<p>More common predefines are documented in the section "Common Predefined Macros" of the <a href="gcc/cpp/index.html">GNU C preprocessor manual</a>.

<p>Note that these predefines can also be used in handwritten assembler code when making sure that the preprocessor is firstly invoked before the assembling faze:
<pre>
   *gcc -xassembler-with-cpp -o file.o -c file.s
</pre>
<p>with e.g. file.s:
<pre>
	@ Returns 1 when running with UnixLib, 0 when running with SharedCLibrary.
	.global	using_unixlib
	.type	using_unixlib, %function
using_unixlib:
#ifdef __TARGET_UNIXLIB__
	MOV	r0, #1
#else
	MOV	r0, #0
#endif
	MOV	pc, r14
	.size	using_unixlib, . - using_unixlib
</pre>

<h4>1.7. Migrating projects to GCCSDK 4</h4>

<p>The GCCSDK 4 release contains a significant number of changes compared to its previous stable GCCSDK 3.4.6 release and this might require some changes to your project when you want to build it with GCCSDK 4.

<ul>
  <li>Object format is ELF
      <p>Pre GCCSDK 4 releases had as object format AOF (Acorn Object Format) and the AOF based libraries came as ALF (Acorn Library Format).  RISC&nbsp;OS Absolute programs (filetype &amp;FF8) came in an AIF file format (Acorn Image Format).
      <p>As those formats are not supported by GNU binutils' assembler 'gas' nor linker 'ld', this means that your projects needs to be completely rebuilt as you can not use previously made (or supplied) AOF/ALF files. In case of C or C++ files this is most probably just a case of recompiling.  In case of assembler files, the sources need to be changes to make them 'gas' compatible (read further on).  In case of creating library, the process can be slightly different (read further on).
      <p>Both object files, shared library files and resulting fully linked binary files are in ELF file format (filetype &amp;E1F).  There is no native RISC&nbsp;OS support for loading shared libraries and ELF linked binary files so that's why you need an ELF loader such like 'SOManager' (currently part of !SharedLibs application).
      <p>There are two ways to create AIF based program files which of course do not need the use of 'SOManager' to run those programs:
         <ul>
            <li>Use <a href="elf2aif">elf2aif</a> program to convert an ELF binary not using any shared library into AIF.  This means you need to specify '-static' linker switch when making ELF binary.
            <li>Use the SharedCLibrary instead of UnixLib as runtime library, i.e. use '-mlibscl' during compilation and linking.  In this case the linker will automatically create an AIF application program so no explicit <a href="elf2aif">elf2aif</a> invocation is needed.
         </ul>
      <p>Aside: when creating a module (i.e. using '-mmodule' during compilation and linking), the intermediate object files are ELF based but the final binary produced by the linker is a valid RISC&nbsp;OS module which of course does not need the 'SOManager' ELF loader.

  <li>Assembler code
      <p>As the object format is ELF you need to make use of an assembler outputing ELF. There are two options:
         <ul>
            <li>You use <a href="asasm">asasm</a> (previously known as 'as' which was originally written by Niklas Röjemo).  'asasm' is designed to be Acorn objasm compatible and will by default output ELF object format.
            <li>You use <a href="gas/index.html">GNU assembler as</a> but this means that your assembler code needs to be tuned for 'gas' assembler syntax.
         </ul>

  <li>'gas' assembler syntax
      <p>The syntax used for 'gas' is slightly different and the most important differences are:
         <ul>
            <li>Labels : 'as' assembler labels start at the beginning of a line can be optionally be pre- and postfixed with a '|' character like "mylabel" or "|mylabel|". 'gas' does not support the optional '|' character and requires that a label gets terminated with a column ':'.
                <p>So, 'as' assembler code like:
                <p>
<pre>
|mylabel1|

            <li>Macros are quite different and there are no mechanical easy rules for translation.  Refer to <a href="gas/index.html">GNU assembler as</a> for full description on '.macro' and '.mend'.
         </ul>
      <p>More information can be found in <a href="gas/index.html">GNU assembler as</a> and in this <a href="http://microcross.com/GNU-ARM-Assy-Quick-Ref.pdf">GNU ARM Assembler Quick Reference</a>.
  <li>Specifying how to link with libraries : the 'drlink' linker used in pre-GCCSDK 4 releases was quite liberal dealing with object and library files and didn't need any special handling to make a difference between those two file formats so in pre-GCCSDK 4 projects you could see link lines like:
<pre>
*gcc -o myapp object1.o object2.o OSLib:o.OSLib32
</pre>
      <p>which links the object1.o and object2.o object files with the RISC&nbsp;OS OSLib library found as OSLib:o.OSLib32.  The binutils' linker needs to have its libraries specified with '-l' switch and further assumes that all libraries filenames on disc start with 'lib' (but omitted when specified) and have an 'a' extension instead of 'o' which was usually used in pre-GCCSDK 4 projects.  Also it is preferred to specify the directory where the library can be found using an extra switch '-L' (in fact, this specifies an additional search directory for the '-l' libraries). So above example needs to be changed for GCCSDK 4 as:
<pre>
*gcc -o myapp object1.o object2.o -LOSLib: -lOSLib32
</pre>
      <p>and this with the file "libOSLib32/a" stored in the directory defined by the 'OSLib:' path. Note we don't do suffix swapping for 'a' extensions. Of course, it is expected that ELF releases of libraries already have the 'lib' prefix and '/a' extension of the library filename.

  <li>APCS-R / APCS-32 : when switch '-mapcs-32' is used, you have to remove this from the command line as this is default now and there isn't any APCS-R support foreseen.  When your project is still APCS-R, you need to drag it into the 21st century and make it APCS-32 compliant.  When you don't have any assembler code in your project, this is just a matter of recompiling your project.

  <li>Softfloat &amp; hardfloat: the default configuration is now softfloat which means that there is no use of floating point instructions which are most of times emulated with a significant overhead. The floating point implementation is done using built-in library support not requiring the FPEmulator module in RISC&nbsp;OS.
      <p>This change has hardly any effect on your project when you migrate to GCCSDK 4 except for the improved runtime speed for floating point intensive code.
</ul>

<h4>1.8. Distributing your programs</h4>

<p>When you want to distribute your compiled program it might be necessary to accompany it with an ELF loader and possibly also a set of shared libraries used by your program. This is not necessary when your program is a static ELF binary which has been converted with <a href="elf2aif">elf2aif</a> or when it is using SharedCLibrary as runtime library (as for both cases your program is an Absolute (filetype &amp;FF8) file with AIF header) or when it is a RISC&nbsp;OS module (filetype &amp;FFA).

<p>The ELF loader and the default set of shared libraries (UnixLib, libgcc and the dynamic loader) are bundled in the form of the !SharedLibs application.  In the <a href="http://www.riscos.info/index.php/GCC_for_RISC_OS#Download">download section of the GCC page</a> there is separate 'core' !SharedLibs ZIP file available which can be downloaded by the users of your program.  You will also need the C support and possibly also the C++ support additions.

<p>We strongly recommend that you instruct your users to download !SharedLibs ZIP file(s) themselves instead of providing a copy of a possibly outdated version together with your program.

<h4>1.9. Troubleshooting</h4>

<p>Here are described some common problems users have with gcc and the GNU compilers. Possible solutions are provided for the known problems.

<ul>
<li>Double clicking on !GCC filer icon results in an error &quot;There are still SharedUnixLibrary clients active&quot;.
    <p>GCCSDK 4 requires at least SharedUnixLibrary version 1.12. This error is because you have a version loaded in memory which is prior to that version and still currently in use by one or more UnixLib compiled programs.

    <p>Loading a newer version of the SharedUnixLibrary is not possible until all those UnixLib compiled programs have been stopped.

    <p>You should quit all those UnixLib compiled programs and again double click on !GCC filer icon.

<li>Double clicking on !GCC filer icon results in an error &quot;GCCSDK 4 requires SharedUnixLibrary 1.12 or later&quot;.
    <p>You have no or a not up-to-date version of the SharedUnixLibrary module in your !System.  Use the GCCSDK supplied !System and use the System merge utility provided by Configure to merge this with your !System.

<li>The compiler fails to compile anything but no error message is reported.
    <p>This is usually caused by a lack of memory. To see how far through compilation a file has gone, try compiling with the '-v' switch. '-v' gives verbose output and will show the programs gcc is executing.

    <p>A lack of memory will be shown up by an almost instantaneous return from any program executed. If this happens, try increasing the wimpslot, using *wimpslot -min 15000K.

    <p>When the compiler runs out of memory during compilation, an error 'virtual memory exhausted' is usually reported.

<li>The error 'No writable memory at this address' is returned.
    <p>This is caused by insufficient memory memory and can be fixed by increasing the wimpslot to similar values as above.
</ul>

<h3>2. UnixLib</h3>
<h4>2.1. Locales</h4>

<p> Standard locale names in the form language-territory[.codeset], where language is an ISO 639 language code and territory is an ISO 3166 country code, are recognised and returned by setlocale. For example, the United Kingdom is "en-GB". The codeset is ignored, but accepted. The following table lists the locales that are recognised and the corresponding RISC OS territory:

<table border="3">
  <tr> <th>RISC OS Territory</th> <th>Locale name</th> </tr>

<p>The special locales "C" and the equivalent "POSIX" are also recognised, but obviously have no corresponding territory name.

<h4>2.2. Shared library compatibility</h4>

<p>Sometimes it's necessary to make changes to UnixLib or the way it is compiled that make it incompatible with previous versions of the compiler or programs built with a previous compiler version. For programs that are statically linked this is not a problem as all the code required to run the program is packaged up inside the program itself. However, with dynamic linking problems can arise when trying to run a program built with an older version of the compiler using a newer version of the UnixLib shared library (and other runtime libraries).

<p>To overcome this, we use ABI (Application Binary Interface) versioning. The compiler embeds the current version of the ABI, as a string, into any libraries or programs that it builds. This string is used by the dynamic linker to identify the sub directory within "!SharedLibs.lib" from which to load the correct libraries.

<p>If a change is made in UnixLib or the way it's built that would make it incompatible with previous versions, then we increase the version number of the ABI. This allows different versions of the standard libraries (or in fact any library) to exist at the same time, and the dynamic linker will select the correct one a runtime.

<p>The currently known ABI versions are:
<li>abi-0.0<br>
This corresponds to V4.1.1 of GCC. As the ABI system was introduced sometime after the release of this version of the compiler, it was not possible to "retro-fit" ABI versioning, so GCC 4.1.1 is only notionally ABI-0.0. Its libraries are stored in "!SharedLibs.lib" directly rather than in an ABI directory.
<li>abi-1.0<br>
This corresponds to V4.1.2 of GCC. This is the first version of GCC that supports the ABI versioning system. Its libraries are stored in "!SharedLibs.lib.abi-1/0".
<li>abi-2.0<br>
This is the current ABI version and corresponds to V4.6 and onwards of GCC. Its libraries are stored in "!SharedLibs.lib.abi-2/0".

<h3>3. Known issues or unsupported GCCSDK 3.4.6 features</h3>

<p>List of known problems or missing features compared to GCCSDK 3.4.6:
<ul>
  <li>native RISC&nbsp;OS build: not all RISC&nbsp;OS specific switches are implemented yet, like -mamu, -mlibrary-static-data-offset, -mclient-static-data-offset.
</ul>

<h3>4. Changes</h3>

<p>GCCSDK 4 produces ELF object files, libraries and binaries while in GCCSDK 3 this was AOF/AIF based.  Currently there is no support to mix AOF object or library files with ELF object files.

<p>For each GCCSDK release an overview of the most important changes are made in its <a href="Changes">Changes</a> file.

  <li><a href="SharedCLibrary">SharedCLibrary</a>: this is an alternative runtime library which is using the SharedCLibrary RISC&nbsp;OS module.  It has the advantage that those applications are usually smaller in size but does not have a rich API as UnixLib. When building modules, this is the only runtime library you can use.
