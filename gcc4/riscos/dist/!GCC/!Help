           Welcome to GCCSDK GCC 4.1.1 Prerelease 1 for RISC OS
                     http://gccsdk.riscos.info/

                        *** EXPERIMENTAL ***

This document covers important notes for new users and existing users alike.
GCC and UnixLib have undergone many changes, so it's important that you read
this document fully.

If you're new to GCC:

 - The !GCC application contains everything you need to get started
   programming in RISC OS.

   To get started using GCC, read !GCC.docs.Intro


If you've used GCC before:

- GCCSDK 4 produces ELF object files, libraries and binaries while in GCCSDK
  3 this was AOF/AIF based.  Currently there is no support to mix AOF object
  or library files with ELF object files.

- The file !GCC.Changes lists major changes from the last version.
  !GCC.docs.UnixLib.Changes has a comprehensive list of changes to UnixLib.


License:

  GCCSDK release made by the GCCSDK Developers consists of several binaries
  and sources which have different licenses.  The following overview can
  help to identify those licenses but is in no way an authoritative statement
  on behalf of the GCCSDK Developers:

  - gcc (and all its associated files) : See !GCC.docs.gcc
  - binutils (and all its associated files) : See !GCC.docs.binutils
  - cmunge : See !GCC.docs.cmunge.Copyright
  - elf2aif : See !GCC.docs.elf2aif.COPYING
  - libscl : See !GCC.docs.libscl.COPYING
  - UnixLib : See !GCC.docs.libunixlib.COPYING
  - mkresfs : See !GCC.docs.mkresfs.COPYING


Credits:

  Primary Developers today :

  - John Tytgat - Release management, allround GCCSDK hacking.
  - Lee Noar - Shared library development.
  - Peter Naulls - UnixLib (all areas, especially glibc compatibility).
  - Alex Waugh - UnixLib (especially signals, pthreads, file handling).

  An enormous amount of porting and testing work was done by Nick Burrett.
  Without his contribution GCCSDK wouldn't exist.

  The following people have also made contributions over the last four years
  (in alphabetic order) :

    Ben Avison, John-Mark Bell, Stefan Bellon, Alan Buckley, James Bursa,
    Steve Ellacott, Rich Hudson, Rob Kendrick, Jeffrey Lee, Christian Ludlam,
    Alex Macfarlane Smith, Theo Markettos, David Marston, Philip Pemberton,
    Graham Shaw, Tony van der Hoff, Simon Wilson, Martin Wuerthner.

  Special thanks to the following people having written programs which are
  used in the GCCSDK project :

  - Justin Fletcher and Robin Watts for 'CMunge', a free alternative to CMHG.
  - Rob Kendrick for his 'mkresgen', a C code generator to add/remove files
    to/from ResourceFS.
  - All UnixLib Developers for providing a run-time library which is
    essential for GCCSDK and ported programs using GCCSDK.

  Thanks also to all the testers and bug reporters.

  And last but not least, all the GCC and binutils contributers.

GCCSDK Developers, 2007
