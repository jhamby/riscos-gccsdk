SysLogD Documentation

Version: v0.02
Author:  John Tytgat / BASS

What ?
------

SysLogD is a small RISC OS module which listens to the UDP 514 port
and logs incoming syslog messages using DoggySoft's !Syslog
application.

It should work with RISC OS 3.1 up to RISC OS 4.  It has only been
tested with the Acorn Internet 5 stack.

Install
-------

Copy SysLogD into the Boot:Choices.Boot.PreDesk directory and make sure
that the !SysLog application gets Filer_Run'ed.  The log file is
written at <SysLog$LogDir>.SysLogD.

History
-------

v0.01 : first version released only to a couple of people.
v0.02 : using CMunge instead of Acorn's CMHG (generates cooler code
        for RISC OS 4) + cleaned up code a bit.

Recompiling
-----------

C source code is provided for those who are interested in it.  Please
