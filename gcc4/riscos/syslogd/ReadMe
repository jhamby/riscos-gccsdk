SysLogD Documentation
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: v0.03
Author:  John Tytgat / BASS

What ?
------

SysLogD is a small RISC OS module which listens to the UDP 514 port
and logs incoming syslog messages using DoggySoft's !Syslog
application or using RISC OS Select's built in Syslog module.

It should work with RISC OS 3.1 up to RISC OS 5.  It has only been
tested with the Acorn Internet 5 stack.

Install
-------

Copy SysLogD into the Boot:Choices.Boot.PreDesk directory and for
RISC OS 3, RISC OS 4 and RISC OS 5 users make sure that the
DoggySoft's !SysLog application gets Filer_Run'ed (the log file is
written at <SysLog$LogDir>.SysLogD).  RISC OS Select users should
not use DoggySoft's !SysLog but use the standard built in Syslog
module.

From version 0.03 onwards, pre RISC OS 5 users should install
the 32 bit versions of system resources (especially the
SharedCLibrary).  You can find this at

History
-------

v0.01 :
  - First version released only to a couple of people.
v0.02 (16 Oct 1999) :
  - Using CMunge instead of Acorn's CMHG (generates cooler code
    for RISC OS 4) + cleaned up code a bit.
v0.03 (22 Jan 2003) :
  - Compiling for APCS-32 so resulting module should be 32-bit /
    26-bit compatible.
  - Used Acorn's CMHG again as CMunge is not yet 32-bit compatible.

Recompiling
-----------

C source code is provided for those who are interested in it.  Please
report any problems and bugfixes to the source code to the author
<URL:mailto:John.Tytgat@aaug.net>.

You need the following for its recompilation :

- Acorn C compiler version 5.
- The o.inetlibzm and o.socklibzm object files and their
  accompagning header files which are available from Acorn's
  SocketLib distribution.  You can find a copy in the archives
  of the Acorn FTP site (e.g. CDROM archives) and/or the
  RISCOS Ltd. website : <URL:http://www.riscos.com/>
  You can also find a copy in Castle's 26/32bit Acorn C/C++
  Tools <URL:http://www.castle.uk.co/castle/software.htm>.
- Version 0.02 only :
    - CMunge : a free alternative to CMHG written by Robin Watts
      <URL:mailto:Robin@wss.co.uk> and Justin Fletcher
      <URL:justin@riscos.com>.
