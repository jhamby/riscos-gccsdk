SysLogD Documentation

What ?
------

SysLogD is a small RISC OS module which listens to the UDP 514 port
and logs incoming syslog messages using DoggySoft's !Syslog
application or using RISC OS Select's built in Syslog module.
Additionally it can produce throwback from messages created by the
gccsdk cross compiler.

It should work with RISC OS 3.1 up to RISC OS 6.  It has only been
tested with the Acorn Internet 5 stack.

Install
-------

Copy SysLogD into the Boot:Choices.Boot.PreDesk directory and for
RISC OS 3, RISC OS 4 and RISC OS 5 users make sure that the
DoggySoft's !SysLog application gets Filer_Run'ed (the log file is
written at <SysLog$LogDir>.SysLogD).  RISC OS Select or RISC OS 6
users should not use DoggySoft's !SysLog but use the standard built
in Syslog module.

From version 0.03 onwards, pre RISC OS 5 users should install
the 32 bit versions of system resources (especially the
SharedCLibrary).  You can find this at
<URL:http://www.iyonix.com/32bit/system.shtml>.

Throwback
---------

To use SysLogD with the gccsdk cross compiler to produce throwback
for error and warning messages, you need to:
 - Set up the cross compiler as described in the gccsdk
   documentation.
 - Ensure that the files being compiled on the remote machine are
   also accessible on the local machine, typically via a network
   filing system.
 - Create a mappings file so that SysLogD can map pathnames on the
   remote machine to the local RISC OS path.
 - Load the SysLogD module (the mappings file is only read once
   when the module initialises).

The mappings file should be created as a plain text file in the
Boot:Choices.syslogd directory. Each line specifies one mapping,
and consists of the unix path, a space, then the corresponding
RISC OS path. For example:
/home/alex Sunfish::alex.$

This will match any path starting with /home/alex, remove it and
replace it with Sunfish::alex.$ and then translate the rest of the
path by substituting dots for slashes and vice-versa. Note that if
the pathname contains any unusual characters that the filing system
has to do some other translation on then this mapping will not
work.

History
-------

v0.01 :
  - First version released only to a couple of people.
v0.02 (16 Oct 1999) :
  - Using CMunge instead of Acorn's CMHG (generates cooler code
    for RISC OS 4) + cleaned up code a bit.
v0.03 (22 Jan 2003) :
  - Compiling for APCS-32 so resulting module should be 32-bit /
    26-bit compatible.
  - Used Acorn's CMHG again as CMunge is not yet 32-bit compatible.
v0.04 (16 Jul 2007) :
  - Added throwback support for use with the gccsdk.
v0.05 (21 Apr 2010) :
  - GCCSDK 4 build changes

Recompiling
-----------

C source code is provided for those who are interested in it.  Please
report any problems and bugfixes to the source code to the author
<URL:mailto:John.Tytgat@aaug.net>.

You need the following for its recompilation :

- GCCSDK GCC 4.1.1 Release 3 <http://gccsdk.riscos.info/>
