GDB server protocol
===================

Protocol documentation may be found in appendix D of the GDB manual:
  http://sources.redhat.com/gdb/current/onlinedocs/gdb_34.html

The receive state machine implemented in gdb.c looks like this:

	+------>WAITING_FOR_PACKET<-+
	|		|	|   |	Interrupt application.
	|		|    ^C +---+
	|	      $ |
	|		|
	|		v
	|	READ_PACKET_DATA
	|		|	Accumulate data into buffer.
	|		|	Compute packet checksum as we go.
	|	      # |
	|		|
	|		v
	|	READ_CHECKSUM1
	|		|	Save nibble.
	|		|
	|   [0-9a-fA-F] |
	|		|
	|		v
	|	READ_CHECKSUM2
	|		|	Generate reference checksum.
	|		|	Compare with calculated checksum.
	+---------------+	If they match, ack the packet and process it.
				If they don't match, send a nack.

Packet processing simply implements the spec, so consult that for reference.
