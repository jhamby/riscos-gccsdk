Things that need doing before this can be released
--------------------------------------------------

 + Break requests are pretty temperamental
 + The memory access commands are quite capable of taking out the machine. 
   GDB itself may need teaching about our stack structure to avoid this 
   happening when the user attempts to get a backtrace.
 + Error checking/handling (there's not much at present)
