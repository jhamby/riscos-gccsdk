THE DIGITAL RENDERER MODULE, V0.52
==================================



NOTE ON VERSION 0.52 (15 Jan 2006)
==================================

There are no new features here, I only updated the documentation slightly.
This version of the module is released under the GPL.


NOTE ON MINI-BUGFIX VERSION 0.51 (17 Jun 2003)
**********************************************

This version merely fixes a tiny bug that has been in the module for ages
and only caused problems on IYONIX pc computers with Aemulor loaded -- the SWI
chunk base in the module header accidentally had the X-bit set. Because it's
such a small fix I chose not to change the version number.


IMPORTANT NOTES FOR VERSION 0.51 (9 Feb 2003)
*********************************************

It's 32bit compatible and my email address changed. End of message.


IMPORTANT NOTES FOR VERSION 0.50:
*********************************

There's a new call to activate the DigitalRenderer using the 16bit sound
system where available: DigitalRenderer_Activate16. Normally you'll want
to use this in preference over DigitalRenderer_Activate (unless you want
more than 2 channels because the 16bit sound system doesn't support more);
in case the call fails, use the old one.
16bit sound automatically expands mono samples to stereo and scales them
according to the currently active volume, so you don't have to take care
of any of these things.

The parameters to the SWI DigitalRenderer_SetDefaults (&4f70e) have changed
slightly, i.e. r5 was added. I don't know of anyone (except for myself) using
the features of 0.40 yet, so I hope this won't pose problems to anyone. But
the addition of 16bit sound required a new parameter and I didn't want to
define a new SWI just for the default frequency, although it'd have been
the cleanest solution.



IMPORTANT NOTES FOR VERSION 0.40:
*********************************

Since version 0.40 Digital Renderer uses voice generators; see the short
paragraph at the end of this section for what this means. Another addition
in this version is the filing system DRender: which allows Unix-like writing
of samples to a pseudo-device for playback. See below.

This module provides a polling-, call-back or streaming interface between
applications and the sound system. It should be used if you wish to play back a
sample of unknown length like when emulating another computer's sound system
and/or control playback from applications which might be mapped out during WIMP
polls. Otherwise you better use voice generators. It has been extended and
modified a lot since its first version which provided just the single-buffer
polling interface used for my port of Frodo. With Doom It Yourself came the
addition of the call back handler (but newer versions of DIY have moved to
voice handlers), the Vice port required support for 16bit samples (which are
internally converted to 8bit ulaw ATM, though) and since Vice1.5 there's
also been a streaming interface. Maybe I'll add a filing system one day so
you can dump samples directly to a streaming device a la Unix; that should
simplify some ports, but ATM I don't see a big need for this.

Prior to activating it you can choose whether you want to use a streaming
approach by configuring the number of buffers to a value larger than 0. In
this case you can stream in numbuffers * buffersize samples, but you have to
take care that you don't write more samples to avoid wraparound because the
streaming calls are non-blocking (use DigitalRenderer_StreamStatistics to
read the number of filled buffers and only fill the free ones). I hate blocking
calls.

You tell it the number of channels, sample period and buffer size (as needed for
SWI Sound_Configure) when activating it. The module will then claim buffer(s) of
the specified size, depending on the mode you're running in:

1) Call-back interface: no buffer will be needed.
2) Normal, single-buffer interface (numbuffers = 0): one buffer will be needed.
3) Streaming interface: numbuffers buffers are claimed.

(where numbuffers is the value passed to DigitalRenderer_NumBuffers)

Your job as a client is either polling with DigitalRenderer_ReadState (single)
or DigitalRenderer_StreamStatistics (streaming) and providing new samples when
needed using DigitalRenderer_New[16Bit]Sample (single) or
DigitalRenderer_Stream[16Bit]Samples (streaming), or providing a buffer fill
handler that'll be called by the module when the sample buffer has to be filled
and therefore must reside in non-mappable memory.

DigitalRenderer only supports 8 bit logarithmic sound ATM since I have absolutely
no documentation about 16 bit linear sound (and the PRMs are pretty useless as
far as DMA- and Channel-Handlers are concerned). If any of you provided me with
the necessary docs I might update it.

Voice Generators:
The old versions of the Digital Renderer module replaced the channel handler
which is not something one should normally do, but it worked well enough. Now
I finally got around to changing that behaviour to use the much more standardized
voice generators and thereby reduce compatibility issues in the future. The
change is not entirely transparent, though. A channel handler sees the start
of the sound buffer whereas a voice generator gets a pointer at a certain offset
into the buffer and an incrementor. In order not to break old software what I
do is always claim exactly as many channels as specified and fill all channels
in the voice handler for the first channel, ignoring the others, so everything
should look exactly like it used to to the outside world. Vice for instance handles
it fine, but I can't guarantee that there aren't apps that can't stomach the change
and need adapting. It was a change worth doing, though, since the old channel
handler approach was always a bit of a pain in the neck. While I was at it I also
ironed out a very tricky bug (hopefully) that may have caused very rare crashes.

Filing System DRender:
There is now a filing system "DRender:". What for, you ask? Well, this allows
using samples like on Unix by writing them to a pseudo-device (/dev/dsp). All
you have to do is first configure the defaults (see SWI DigitalRenderer_SetDefaults
or the command DRenderDefaults), open the file and pipe the data in. If you're
running in a TaskWindow you don't even have to take care you don't write too much
data because the module will automatically sleep using UpCall 6 when the buffer
is full (that's the same UpCall the TaskWindow uses to yield control to other
tasks and means that the computer doesn't freeze for the duration). If you're
using this interface from an application, you should check the number of free
buffers using SWI DigitalRenderer_StreamStatistics, however.
The filing system uses the streaming interface. Only one file can be opened
on this filing system. When it's opened, the default values are activated
(number of channels, number of buffers, sample period, ...) and the data is
streamed into the buffers (and the music starts). This might come in very
handy if you're porting applications from Unix. Bear in mind, however, that
the file opened on DRender: should not be buffered, otherwise you might get
strange dropout effects.
NOTE: there is a problem with the *copy command which doesn't work with the
DRender: filing system (at least not in a TaskWindow). I don't know exactly
why that is, maybe copy can't stomach the UpCall or stops interrupts, I just
advise you not to use that command but rather OS_Find / OS_GBPB combinations.



The DigitalRenderer uses SWI chunk &4f700 and filing system number 167 (both
officially registered). It provides the following SWI calls:







DigitalRenderer_Activate		SWI &4F700
========================


On Entry:
---------

R0	bits 0-7: number of channels, will get rounded up to (1,2,4,8).
	bit 31: clear ==> use polling, otherwise call back buffer fill code.
R1	Sample length (bytes per channel, must be a multiple of 16 bytes)
R2	Sample period (microseconds between reading two consecutive sample bytes)
R3	pointer to buffer fill code if R0 bit 31 set.


On Exit:
--------

---


Usage:
------

Your application must call this SWI to take over the sound system. For typical
values of sample length and sample period see PRM 4. Once (successfully)
activated things like the system beep won't work any more.
This call activates the old 8bit system. Use DigitalRenderer_Activate16 to try
using 16bit sound.


Sample length:
--------------

As documented in the PRMs, this denotes the number of bytes per channel to use
as DMA buffer. Note that at least newer machines (RO3.7, probably due to 16bit
sound) seem to have trouble extending this beyond 512 bytes even in 1 channel
mode! The buffer size may affect your playback code if it relies getting the
buffer size you specify to this call. You can read the actual buffer size using
SWI "Sound_Configure" with r0-r5 = 0 which will return the buffer size actually
available in r1.
You're subject to the DMA buffer size in case you're providing your own buffer
fill code or you're using the buffer-oriented calls DigitalRenderer_NewSample
and DigitalRenderer_New16BitSample. The streaming interface works even if the
DMA buffer size differs from the configured size: the requested buffer size
will be the granularity of the ring buffer which could have any size; since
only buffers that are entirely filled can be played back it's still not
advisable to make the buffers too big, however.


Buffer Fill Code:
-----------------

The buffer fill code has the following entry/exit conditions:

On Entry:
---------
R0	*buffer (in DMA space)
R1	*LinToLog (8kB lookup table)
R2	buffer length

Processor is in IRQ mode with IRQs enabled. Therefore do not use r14_irq under
any circumstances!

On Exit:
--------
Except for r13_irq no registers have to be preserved. The routine must
return using "LDMIA sp!,{pc}" (the return address is pushed to the stack
_before_ the routine is called).


The buffer fill code has to fill the buffer in the format the VIDC needs, i.e.
all channels interleaved, each channel in 8bit u-law.



Errors:
-------

	- already active
	- can't claim memory for buffer / handler
	- bad buffer size (not a multiple of 16)





DigitalRenderer_Deactivate		SWI &4F701
==========================


On Entry:
---------

---


On Exit:
--------

---


Usage:
------

If your application doesn't need sound any more it must return control to the
old handlers by issuing this SWI.


Errors:
-------

	- not active





DigitalRenderer_Pause			SWI &4F702
=====================


On Entry:
---------

---


On Exit:
--------

---


Usage:
------

This SWI suspends sound playback (disabling DMA on sample buffers and so on).
In contrast to deactivating DR this will not install the old handlers but merely
mute the entire sound system.


Errors:
-------

	- not active





DigitalRenderer_Resume			SWI &4F703
======================


On Entry:
---------

---


On Exit:
--------

---


Usage:
------

Call this to resume playback after it was paused.


Errors:
-------

	- not active





DigitalRenderer_GetTables		SWI &4F704
=========================


On Entry:
---------

---


On Exit:
--------

For 8bit sound only, otherwise undefined:

R0	pointer to 8k LinToLog table for translating 13 bit signed integers
	to 8 bit logarithmic samples as required by the VIDC, scaled to the
	currently selected volume (--> SWI Sound_Volume)

R1	Pointer to 256 byte LogScale table for scaling 8 bit logarithmic
	samples according to the currently selected volume.


Errors:
-------

	- not active





DigitalRenderer_ReadState		SWI &4F705
=========================


On Entry:
---------

---


On Exit:
--------

R0	Digital Renderer State. Bits and their meaning when set:

	0:	DigitalRenderer active
	1:	New sample data required
	2:	Buffer overflow occurred
	5:	16bit sound hardware used


Usage:
------

Call this SWI to poll DigitalRenderer in single-buffer mode. If Bit 1 is set you
have to provide a new sample buffer by calling DigitalRenderer_NewSample. Bit 2
lets you check for buffer overflows (i.e. your application took too long to provide
the next sample).
If you're using the call-back method or the streaming interface, bits 1 and 2 are
undefined. For streaming interface, use SWI DigitalRenderer_StreamStatistics.






DigitalRenderer_NewSample		SWI &4F706
=========================


On Entry:
---------

R0	Pointer to buffer holding new samples (8bit ulaw)


On Exit:
--------

---


Usage:
------

Don't call this SWI if you're using the call-back method or the streaming interface,
this is for single-buffer polling only. Call this when DigitalRenderer_ReadState
returned with Bit 1 set. The buffer must have the correct size (number of channels
times Sample length) and contain data that can be sent directly to the VIDC, i.e. 8
bit logarithmic data, interleafed for multiple channels.


Errors:
-------

	- not active





DigitalRenderer_New16BitSample		SWI &4F707
==============================

On Entry:
---------

R0	Pointer to buffer holding new samples (16bit linear)

On Exit:
--------

---


Usage:
------

Same as DigitalRenderer_NewSample, but the source buffer holds 16bit linear samples
(and hence has to be twice the size of the one used by DigitalRenderer_NewSample).






DigitalRenderer_BufferStatistics	SWI &4F708
================================

On Entry:
---------

---

On Exit:
--------

R0	Buffers played
R1	Buffers provided by application


Usage:
------

A simple method to get statistical information about the playback history in
single-buffer polling mode. Both counters will be reset to zero when the
DigitalRenderer is activated.





DigitalRenderer_NumBuffers		SWI &4F709
==========================

On Entry:
---------

R0	new number of buffers to use in streaming interface, or -1 to read.

On Exit:
--------

R0	number of buffers currently allocated.


Usage:
------

This call must be issued before DigitalRenderer_Activate and initializes
the streaming interface (if R0 > 0). In this mode you can pipe samples into
a ring buffer containing r0 buffers using the DigitalRenderer_Stream*Samples
SWIs. Each buffer is as large as the one specified when activating the
DigitalRenderer (which ideally is the size of the sound hardware's). This
system basically allows caching a large number of samples. You can switch
off the streaming interface when the DigitalRenderer is inactive calling with
R0 = 0.




DigitalRenderer_StreamSamples		SWI &4F70A
=============================

On Entry:
---------

R0	Pointer to buffer holding 8bit ulaw samples
R1	Number of samples

On Exit:
--------

---


Usage:
------

Provide 8bit ulaw samples to the ring buffer in streaming mode. The format is
as required for the sound hardware (see PRM4). The number of samples can be
any size, but should normally not be larger than the ring buffer size or the
call will either block or samples will be truncated, depending on the stream
flags (DigitalRenderer_StreamFlags). Note that the number of samples for all
channels combined and not for an individual channel.




DigitalRenderer_Stream16BitSamples	SWI &4F70B
==================================

On Entry:
---------

R0	Pointer to buffer holding 16bit signed linear samples
R1	Number of samples (not bytes!)

On Exit:
--------

---


Usage:
------

Same as DigitalRenderer_StreamSamples, but the samples are in 16bit signed linear
rather than 8bit ulaw. As in StreamSamples, the number of samples is for all
channels combined.






DigitalRenderer_StreamStatistics	SWI &4F70C
================================

On Entry:
---------

---

On Exit:
--------

R0	Number of buffers filled and waiting to be played.





DigitalRenderer_StreamFlags		SWI &4F70D
===========================

On Entry:
---------

R0	EOR mask
R1	AND mask (applied first)

On Exit:
--------

R0	old stream flags


Usage:
------

Use this to read and change the stream flags. ATM the following flags are defined,
with the following meaning when set:

	1:	fill buffers with 0 on overruns, otherwise repeat last buffer
	2:	use UpCall6 if more data is written to DRender: than fits the buffer.
		That means the task sleeps, otherwise it has to do busy waiting.
	4:	block if more samples are streamed than fit into the buffer

Use R0 = 0, R1 = -1 to read.





DigitalRenderer_SetDefaults		SWI &4F70E
===========================

On Entry:
---------

R0	number of channels or 0 to read
R1	format (1: 8bit ulaw, 2 16bit signed linear, 3: 16bit signed linear channel-swapped)
	or 0 to read
R2	sample period or 0 to read
R3	buffer size per channel or 0 to read
R4	number of buffers for streaming interface
R5	sample frequency; positive values mean: use 16bit RISC OS sound in preference

On Exit:
--------

R0-R5	currently active values


Usage:
------

IMPORTANT NOTE:
Between version 0.40 and 0.50, R5 was added. In case you were using this call
in version 0.40, you'll have to change your code. See the preamble to this
document for more.

Use this SWI to specify the format and the total buffer size of the file you
want to write to the DRender: filing system. The defaults are for 1 channel,
22kHz, 1 second buffering. In case the default frequency is positive, 16bit
sound is tried first, falling back to 8bit if 16bit failed (like on older
hardware), otherwise 8bit is used from the start.





DigitalRenderer_Activate16		SWI &4F70F
==========================

On Entry:
---------

R0	number of channels, must be 1 or 2 (this is a limitation of 16bit RISC OS sound)
R1	buffer size per channel (in samples, not bytes)
R2	frequency
R3	flags
	bit 0:	restore previous handler on exit

On Exit:
--------

all registers preserved.


Usage:
------

Use this SWI to activate the DigitalRenderer using the new 16bit RISC OS sound
rather than the old 8bit system. All other SWIs automatically adapt to the system
chosen without needing to worry about internal details. The call will return with
an error in case no 16bit sound is available.
In stereo mode, the samples are by default assumed to be in the correct order for
left/right channel. If this is not the case, you'll have to call the new SWI
DigitalRenderer_SampleFormat with format 3 (16bit signed linear swapped).






DigitalRenderer_GetFrequency		SWI &4F710
============================

On Entry:
---------

---


On Exit:
--------

R0	sample frequency used, or 0 in case the DigitalRenderer is off.


Usage:
------

Use this call to read the sample frequency in use (may deviate from the one you
specified to DigitalRenderer_Activate[16]).






DigitalRenderer_ActivateAuto		SWI &4F711
============================

On Entry:
---------

R0	number of channels
R1	buffer size per channel
R2	frequency


On Exit:
--------

all registers preserved


Usage:
------

The call for the impatient. This call first tries DigitalRenderer_Activate16 with
R3 = 1 (i.e. restore the previous handler). If that call fails, it converts the
frequency to the nearest sample period available and calls DigitalRenderer_Activate.
Only if that call fails does it return with an error.





DigitalRenderer_SampleFormat		SWI &4F712
============================

On Entry:
---------

R0	new format (see DigitalRenderer_SetDefaults) or 0 to read


On Exit:
--------

R0	format currently used


Usage:
------

This call allows you to change the sample format from the default. The most
important application of this call is to swap left and right channel in 16bit
stereo mode. Changing the format in 8bit mode doesn't have an effect. The call
can be issued at arbitrary times even when the stream is open.










COMMANDS:
=========


DRenderOff
	Switch off the digital renderer module and close the DRender: filing
	system if it was opened.


DRenderDefaults [-c # -f # -p # -s # -n #]
	If no parameters given, print the current defaults, otherwise set
	them. The defaults are used to specify the sample format of data
	you want to write to the DRender: filing system (see also SWI
	DigitalRenderer_SetDefaults). Parameters are
	-c #: set number of channels (1,2,4,8)
	-f #: set sample format: 1 for ubit ulaw, 2 for 16bit signed linear,
	      3 for 16 bit signed linear with left/right channel in wrong order
	-p #: set sample period, e.g. 44 for 44kHz, 23 for 22kHz
	-q #: set sample frequency in Hz. Specifying a positive value automatically
	      tries 16bit sound first, otherwise the old 8bit sound is used.
	-s #: set buffer size per channel (keep it small)
	-n #: set number of buffers to use in streaming interface. You should
	      make this large enough to buffer enough data to keep playback
	      stable (default is 43).


DRenderStatus
	Show a summary of the digital renderer status. In case of 8bit sound,
	the sample period is shown, whereas for 16bit sound the frequency is
	printed.








LEGAL STUFF:
============


The DigitalRenderer module is Freeware. You may use it for your own programs as
long as this file is included unchanged. I won't be held responsible for any kind
of damage resulting from the use of this module, use it entirely at your own risk.
