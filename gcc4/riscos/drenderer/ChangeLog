	* Tidied and slightly improved DRender.h and DRender.s based on
	experience of examining <libunixlib/sound/dsp.c>.
	* A few corrections to the documentation in DocDRender.

Fri Apr 20 19:32:00 CST 2012  Christopher Martin  <belles@internode.on.net>

	* Addressed a grey area in the documentation concerning which 16-bit
	channel ordering, left-right or right-left, is "correct" and which is
	"swapped". The documentation and code now refer explicitly to either
	left-right or right-left. The default is declared to be right-left.
	* Added speculative code that adds some silence after a streamed file
	is closed. It appears on BeagleBoard RISC OS 5.18, a silent tail 3
	times the buffer length is required in order to avoid a nasty buzz if
	the file being played does not end in silence. The tail may in fact be
	smaller than this, depending on the buffer length or sample rate, but
	I found that 2 buffers worth of silence was not enough; 3 was. Iyonix
	RISC OS 5.18 exhibits the same problem but to a lesser degree. I
	haven't experimented enough to determine a precise formulation that is
	sure to work in all cases. And, of course, this code doesn't help when
	the DRender: filesystem isn't being used. This speculative code was
	then commented-out because it may have been responsible for a system
	crash after the application load caused the desktop to stop
	multitasking for a couple of seconds. Besides, adding an arbitrary bit
	of silence to the end of a streamed file is a bodgy solution to what I
	now suspect is an operating system problem. I discovered that PlayIt
	suffers from the same problems on RISC OC 5.18, on BeagleBoard and
	Iyonix, when using its acorn16bit driver.
	* Added code to the 16-bit streamer so that it transfers to the sound
	system only as much data has been written into a buffer, rather than
	the full contents of that buffer which may contain the remnant of a
	previous buffer-fill operation.
	* When the 16-bit linear handler is streaming, before finishing it
	checks for space remaining in the sound system's buffer and writes
	zeroes into any remainder unless the OS has indicated that the buffer
	was preset to silence.
	* Added descriptive comments for some fields in the module work area.
	* Changed some comparisons from signed to unsigned.
	* Bumped version to 0.56 beta 6.

	* Ensure that some dynamic branches preserve any 26-bit PSR in
	the calculated link register. This is vital if flags are to be
	restored on return. Otherwise, the PC may inadvertently be
	switched into USR mode and then very bad things happen.
	* Define and use a new State_Deactivating flag to ensure that
	SWI XDR_Deactivate doesn't invoke itself again as a result of
	closing a file being streamed to the DRender: filesystem.
	* Provide the module's private word in R2 when calling
	Sound_LinearHandler to remove its 16-bit linear handler.

	* Changed default stream flags to remove buzzing when the desktop is
	buzy.

Tue Apr 17 13:49:00 CST 2012  Christopher Martin  <belles@internode.on.net>

	* Ensured that all RMA memory (de-)allocations follow a consistent
	pattern to minimise risks of memory leaks and IRQ-related problems.
	* Re-organised SWIActivate16 to address faults specific to Iyonix and
	BeagleBoard. On Iyonix, the sample rate is set correctly for playback.
	On BeagleBoard, the sample rate is restored correctly after playback.
	* Given that 0.55 has been publicly released, bumped the version to
	0.56 beta 1.
	* A known remaining problem on BeagleBoard with RISC OS 5.18 is the
	presence of a harsh buzz any time playback stops abruptly or is paused
	while the desktop is busy.

Fri Apr 13 17:15:00 CST 2012  Christopher Martin  <belles@internode.on.net>

	* Corrected a bug that would cause stack corruption should SWI
	DigitalRenderer_Activate fail to install its voice generator.
	* Bumped the module version number to 0.55 accordingly.
	* Shortened the copyright notice and bumped the end-year to 2012.

Mon Mar 12 00:56:56 CET 2012  John Tytgat  <John.Tytgat@aaug.net>

	* !!Make,fd7: Add.
	* Makefile: Rename BUILDDIR to CURDIR and only use it where it is
	absolutely needed.
	(clean): Fix RONATIVE case.
	(VPATH): Remove and add SRCDIR explicitly where needed.

Mon Mar 12 00:10:18 CET 2012   Christopher Martin  <belles@internode.on.net>
                               John Tytgat  <John.Tytgat@aaug.net>

	Convert source DRenderer from BASIC to AsAsm/ObjAsm.
	* DigiRendV, stdlib, DRender.o,ffd: Remove.
	* makelogtable.c, DRenderer.s, Makefile: Add.

Sun Mar 11 23:54:31 CET 2012   Christopher Martin  <belles@internode.on.net>

	* DigiRendV, stdlib: Import of v0.54.
	Substantial bugfixes, work-arounds and optimisations for newer systems
	based on ARMv5 and later architectures. The primary fault in 0.52
	addressed by this version could cause some systems to play audio files
	at the wrong speed.
	* DRenderer,ffa: Removed.

Sun Mar 11 23:20:36 CET 2012  John Tytgat  <John.Tytgat@aaug.net>

	* DigiRendV,ffb: Detokenized as DigiRendV.
	* stdlib,ffb: Detokenized as stdlib.

Sun Mar 11 16:08:40 CET 2012  John Tytgat  <John.Tytgat@aaug.net>

	* DRender.s: Fix syntax so it can be assembled with AsAsm.
	* ChangeLog: Add.
