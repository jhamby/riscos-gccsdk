	* Ensure that some dynamic branches preserve any 26-bit PSR in
	the calculated link register. This is vital if flags are to be
	restored on return. Otherwise, the PC may inadvertently be
	switched into USR mode and then very bad things happen.
	* Define and use a new State_Deactivating flag to ensure that
	SWI XDR_Deactivate doesn't invoke itself again as a result of
	closing a file being streamed to the DRender: filesystem.
	* Provide the module's private word in R2 when calling
	Sound_LinearHandler to remove its 16-bit linear handler.

	* Changed default stream flags to remove buzzing when the desktop is
	buzy.

	* Ensured that all RMA memory (de-)allocations follow a consistent
	pattern to minimise risks of memory leaks and IRQ-related problems.
	* Re-organised SWIActivate16 to address faults specific to Iyonix and
	BeagleBoard. On Iyonix, the sample rate is set correctly for playback.
	On BeagleBoard, the sample rate is restored correctly after playback.
	* Given that 0.55 has been publicly released, bumped the version to
	0.56 beta 1.
	* A known remaining problem on BeagleBoard with RISC OS 5.18 is the
	presence of a harsh buzz any time playback stops abruptly or is paused
	while the desktop is busy.

	* Corrected a bug that would cause stack corruption should SWI
	DigitalRenderer_Activate fail to install its voice generator.
	* Bumped the module version number to 0.55 accordingly.
	* Shortened the copyright notice and bumped the end-year to 2012.

Mon Mar 12 00:56:56 CET 2012  John Tytgat  <John.Tytgat@aaug.net>

	* !!Make,fd7: Add.
	* Makefile: Rename BUILDDIR to CURDIR and only use it where it is
	absolutely needed.
	(clean): Fix RONATIVE case.
	(VPATH): Remove and add SRCDIR explicitly where needed.

                               John Tytgat  <John.Tytgat@aaug.net>

	Convert source DRenderer from BASIC to AsAsm/ObjAsm.
	* DigiRendV, stdlib, DRender.o,ffd: Remove.
	* makelogtable.c, DRenderer.s, Makefile: Add.

Sun Mar 11 23:54:31 CET 2012   Christopher Martin  <belles@internode.on.net>

	* DigiRendV, stdlib: Import of v0.54.
	Substantial bugfixes, work-arounds and optimisations for newer systems
	based on ARMv5 and later architectures. The primary fault in 0.52
	addressed by this version could cause some systems to play audio files
	at the wrong speed.
	* DRenderer,ffa: Removed.

Sun Mar 11 23:20:36 CET 2012  John Tytgat  <John.Tytgat@aaug.net>

	* DigiRendV,ffb: Detokenized as DigiRendV.
	* stdlib,ffb: Detokenized as stdlib.

Sun Mar 11 16:08:40 CET 2012  John Tytgat  <John.Tytgat@aaug.net>

	* DRender.s: Fix syntax so it can be assembled with AsAsm.
	* ChangeLog: Add.
