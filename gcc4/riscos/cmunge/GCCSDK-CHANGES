The official CMunge v0.76 contains nearly all the changes needed for usage
in the GCCSDK 3.4 project.  For GCCSDK 4 we had to made additional changes
for ELF, instead of AOF, object format support only affecting the operation
of the -tgcc option.  Two new features have been added : printer driver
handler and no-SCL support.

More detailed overview of the changes made so far:

  - GCCSDK specific build structure changes.
  - Hiding RISC OS specific build files (Makefile,fe1, !Mk*,fd7 files)
  - Marked "[with GCCSDK 4 changes]" Module_FullVersionAndDate of VersionNum
    which makes startup message and generated files are marked as such.
  - -tgcc option supports ELF object format and no longer AOF object format.
  - Added 'pdriver-handler' keyword for those wanting to create printer driver
    module code. Added an example for this new feature.
    Added explanation on 'pdriver-handler' in manual.
  - Added the posibility to create modules without using the Shared C Library
    runtime (option -znoscl) + manual update.
  - Several manual typo fixes.
  - Source improvements:
    - strduptok/strfindpair/strstring : use memcpy() instead of strncpy() for
      more clearness.
    - constify a lot of pointers where it made sense.

The GCCSDK-DIFF file contains those changes in diff format and are submitted
back to the CMunge authors for possible inclusion in future versions.  It is
generated using:

  $ svn diff svn://svn.riscos.info/gccsdk/branches/CMungeImportBranch/cmunge svn://svn.riscos.info/gccsdk/trunk/gcc4/riscos/cmunge
