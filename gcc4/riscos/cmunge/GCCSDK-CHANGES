The official CMunge v0.76 contains nearly all the changes needed for usage
in the GCCSDK 3.4 project.  For GCCSDK 4 we had to made additional changes
for ELF, instead of AOF, object format support and this only affects the
operation of the -tgcc option.

Overview of the changes made so far:

  - GCCSDK specific build structure changes.
  - hiding RISC OS specific build files (Makefile,fe1, !Mk*,fd7 files)
  - marked "[GCCSDK 4]" via the CMunge printf() in main()
  - -tgcc option supports ELF object format and no longer AOF object format.

The GCCSDK-DIFF file contains those changes in diff format and are submitted
back to the CMunge authors for possible inclusion in future versions.  It is
generated using:

  $ svn diff svn://svn.riscos.info/gccsdk/branches/CMungeImportBranch/cmunge svn://svn.riscos.info/gccsdk/trunk/gcc4/riscos/cmunge
