The official CMunge v0.76 contains nearly all the changes needed for usage
in the GCCSDK 3.4 project.  For GCCSDK 4 we had to made additional changes
for ELF, instead of AOF, object format support only affecting the operation
of the -tgcc option.  Two new features have been added : printer driver
handler and no-SCL support.

More detailed overview of the changes made so far:

  - GCCSDK specific build structure changes.
  - Hiding RISC OS specific build files (Makefile,fe1, !Mk*,fd7 files)
  - Added to Module_FullVersionAndDate of VersionNum the substring
    "[with GCCSDK 4 changes including r" followed by the Subversion revision
    number of the code base used to make the cmunge binary.
    This will be visible in the startup message and generated files will be
    similary marked as well.
  - -tgcc option supports ELF object format and no longer AOF object format.
  - Added 'pdriver-handler' keyword for those wanting to create printer driver
    module code. Added an example for this new feature.
    Added explanation on 'pdriver-handler' in manual.
  - Added the posibility to create modules without using the Shared C Library
    runtime (option -znoscl) + manual update.
  - Several manual typo fixes.
  - Source improvements:
    - strduptok/strfindpair/strstring : use memcpy() instead of strncpy() for
      more clearness.
    - constify a lot of pointers where it made sense.

The GCCSDK-DIFF file contains those changes in diff format and are submitted
back to the CMunge authors for possible inclusion in future versions.  It is
generated using:

  $ svn diff svn://svn.riscos.info/gccsdk/branches/CMungeImportBranch/cmunge svn://svn.riscos.info/gccsdk/trunk/gcc4/riscos/cmunge
