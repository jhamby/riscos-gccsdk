Note for the GCCSDK developers:

This is a copy of CMunge for use in the GCCSDK project.

When importing a new version of CMunge:

 * The original sources are and should first be stored in the
   'svn://svn.riscos.info/gccsdk/branches/CMungeImportBranch/cmunge'
   SVN branch. Then they are merged to the GCCSDK development/stable
   branch (like 'svn://svn.riscos.info/gccsdk/gcc4/riscos/cmunge')
   where all the GCCSDK changes & bug fixes are to be done.

     $ svn merge svn://svn.riscos.info/gccsdk/branches/CMungeImportBranch/cmunge svn://svn.riscos.info/gccsdk/trunk/gcc4/riscos/cmunge

   Do not make any bug fixes or changes in the 'CMungeImportBranch' branch
   except for importing newer offical CMunge source releases.

 * Then the official sources in the 'CMungeImportBranch' SVN branch are
   tagged using 'svn://svn.riscos.info/gccsdk/tags/CMunge-X_YZ/cmunge' tags
   where 'X_YZ' is the 'Module_MajorVersion_CMHG' #define value in the
   'VersionNum' file but having its dot character changed into a
   underscore character.

     [ Replace 'X_YZ' in the following ! ]
     $ svn copy svn://svn.riscos.info/gccsdk/branches/CMungeImportBranch/cmunge svn://svn.riscos.info/gccsdk/tags/CMunge-X_YZ/cmunge

Doing this in a consistent way allows us to easily find out what the
GCCSDK changes are in the CMunge GCCSDK version.

An overview of all GCCSDK changes has to be kept up-to-date in
'GCCSDK-CHANGES' file.

When additional changes would be needed in the future, please read the
CMunge licence (the 'Docs/Copyright' file) carefully and follow it, like
submitting your changes back to the CMunge authors.  The CMunge authors
expressed their wish not to make any incompatible changes to the GCCSDK
CMunge version.
