This application is Copyright (C) 1999-2002 Robin Watts/Justin Fletcher. It
may be freely distributed as long as:

1) The source code/binary remains unchanged.
2) The documentation is always distributed with the source or binary.
3) The sources may be removed from the archive to make a binary
   distribution, but the documentation must still be included.
4) No charge (except a nominal copying/media fee (1UKP max)) may be made for
   this software.
5) This software may not be supplied with any commercial piece of software
   without written permission from the authors.

If you wish to distribute a changed version of this software, then you may do
so under the following conditions:

1) Any changes made should be passed back to the authors for possible
   inclusion in future versions.
2) A file is included that documents the changes made.
3) The software should output a note to the effect that it has been changed.
4) The same rules re: distribution still apply.

If you wish to distribute the software in other ways than this, then please
contact the authors for permission.

Specific exceptions to these distribution rules are as follows:

1) This program may NOT be included on a magazine cover disc without
   permission; we want to make sure that only the latest version gets
   shipped.

2) This program may NOT be included on a commercially distributed CDROM
   without permission; same reason, and we may ask for a copy of the CDROM at
   media cost.

When in doubt, contact the authors.

We have toyed with the idea of asking for free copies of any commercial
software created using this tool, but that seems a bit greedy! Anyone
wishing to encourage future development however can feel free to offer us
software out of the goodness of their hearts though :-)
