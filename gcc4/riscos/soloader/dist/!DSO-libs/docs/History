History
-------
V1.03
24/8/06
	Fixed bug in module that caused crash on IYONIX pc and later versions
	of RISC OS 4 (SWI handler corrupted r9).
V1.02
21/7/06
	Altered documentation to reflect change to ELF GCC V3.4.6 which
	makes explicit use of -fPIC at link time unnecessary.
V1.01
1/6/06
ld-1.9.9.so
	Somewhere between binutils 2.15 and 2.16.1 the visibility of the
	symbol _GLOBAL_OFFSET_TABLE_ apparently changed which the dynamic
	loader used to find the public GOT of the dependant libraries.
	After wasting a lot of time trying to figure how, I decided to
	change the dynamic loader to use a different method.
1/1/06
module/so-module.s
	Fixed bug in SOM_IterateObjects that returned a non NULL handle after
	the last object.
	Fixed bug that allowed the same client to be deregistered more than
	once.
	
9/12/05
module/so-module.s
	Moved cached values from module memory to client memory to prevent
	clashes between tasks running at same time.
	
	Fixed bug that shows expiry pending when library still in use.
V1.00
19/11/05
	Official filetype of &1C8 used for symlink files.
	Added *SOMExpire.
	Added expiry time to *SOMStatus display.

12/11/05
	Fixed expiry bugs in SOManager.

6/11/05
static/main.s
	Fixed bug that caused crash with empty LD$Env.

23/10/05
static/main.s
	Do not look for default loader - return error if requested loader is
	not found.
	
7/10/05
	Switch to official SWI chunk 0x58580.
	
V0.04
21/8/05
dynamic/ld.so-1.9.9/d-link/boot1.c
	The DT_INIT functions of the shared libraries cannot be called by
	the dynamic loader as UnixLib has not been initialised. This means
	that, for example, malloc and stdio cannot be used in global object
	constructors. To overcome this, the code in the dynamic loader
	responsible for calling the DT_INIT functions is moved to a separate
	function that can be called from crt1.o at the correct time.

modules/main.s
	SOManager now refuses to quit if there are still clients using it.
	
	Improved *SOMStatus display.
V0.03
30/7/05
rt_lib/_rt_loadpic.s
	Changed visibility of symbol __rt_load_pic to hidden to prevent it
	being visible outside each library.

28/7/05
	SOManager no longer responsible for loading dynamic loader at
	initialisation. Static loader now responsible for registering client,
	loading dynamic loader (as requested by program) and registering
	loader.
