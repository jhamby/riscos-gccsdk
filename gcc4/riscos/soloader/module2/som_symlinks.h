/* Resolve a (potential) chain of symlinks.
 *
 * A symlink is a small file of type 0x1C8 which consists of a 4 byte ID word
 * LINK, followed by a 4 byte word giving the length of the following
 * filename. If the filename contains a colon, it is assumed to have an
 * absolute path and completely replaces the symlink filename. Otherwise it
 * is assumed to be relative to the symlink and is added to the symlink's
 * path. The process is repeated on the result until the filename is not a
 * symlink at which point it is returned to the caller.
 *
 * The resulting filename is passed back in a block of memory allocated by
 * SWI "SOM_Alloc" and can be freed with SWI "SOM_Free" when finished with.
