Tue Jan 06 18:42:23 2009  Lee Noar  <leenoar@sky.com>

	* som_register.c(deregister_shared_object): If an object is
	linked to a client, then mark for expiry as before. However,
	if the object is not used by any client then remove
	immediately. Allows the dynamic loader to remove rogue
	libraries if something goes wrong during initialisation.

Fri Sep 19 19:24:56 2008  Lee Noar  <leenoar@sky.com>

	Add support for per client dynamic loader environment:

	* som_runcom.c(read_ld_env): New function to find the
	environment of the dynamic loader for the current client.
	(setup_env_array): Use read_ld_env().
	* som_utils.c, som_utils.h: New files for miscellaneous utility
	functions (wildcmp).
	* Makefile.am: Add som_utils.c.
	* riscos/soloader/dist/!SharedLibs/docs/!ReadMe: Update docs.
	* riscos/dist/!GCC/docs/SharedLibs/!ReadMe: Likewise.

Mon Aug 25 19:23:22 PDT 2008  Peter Naulls  <peter@chocky.org>

	* som_init.c: Better name for dynamic area. 

Sun Aug 10 19:48:45 2008  Lee Noar  <leenoar@sky.com>

	* som_command.c(command_status): Produce a more compact and easier
	to read output for *SOMStatus command. Also allow libraries and
	clients to be listed separately.
	* somanager.cmhg: Update *SOMStatus syntax.
	* riscos/soloader/dist/!SharedLibs/docs/!ReadMe: Update docs.
	* riscos/dist/!GCC/docs/SharedLibs/!ReadMe: Likewise.

Sat Aug 09 13:32:29 2008  Lee Noar  <leenoar@sky.com>

	* som_elf.c(elffile_open): It's possible for the text segment not
	to be a multiple of 4 in size which can create a 'hole' between
	segments due to realignment by the static linker. This can cause
	two problems; 1) The memory size calculation doesn't take the hole
	into account meaning the segments overflow and 2) The free memory
	pointer is not word aligned.
	Rather than adding memory size of segments together, track upper
	limit of memory segments as an offset from the start of the object.

	* som_runcom.c(command_run): To be on the safe side, make sure we
	start with a word aligned free memory pointer.

Wed Jul 09 21:55:34 2008  Lee Noar  <leenoar@sky.com>

	* som_utilswis.c(som_iterate_objects): When the last/first object
	has been returned, make sure r1 (internal handle) is set to 0 on
	exit.

Mon Mar 10 17:17:26 2008  Lee Noar  <leenoar@sky.com>

	* som_runcom.c: Change occurrence of DSOLib: to SharedLibs: as part
	of the process to rename !DSO-libs as !SharedLibs.

Fri Feb  1 00:39:19 2008  Lee Noar  <leenoar@sky.com>

	* som_alloc.c(DA_extend): Wrong pointer passed to heap_block_size().

Fri Jan  4 18:24:23 2008  Lee Noar  <leenoar@sky.com>

	* som_workspace.h: Move runtime workspace to immediately after ELF
	header. Use a new function, rt_workspace_find(), to calculate
	address of runtime workspace using ELF header.
	* som_register.c: Use new function to find workspace.
	* som_array.c: Likewise.

	The following changes were also made to parts of GCCSDK:

	* bfd/elf32-arm.c: Add extra 20 bytes to size of ELF header to use
	as runtime workspace.
	* ld/scripttempl/elf.sc: Remove runtime workspace allocation from
	linker scripts.

	Note that the runtime workspace has been reduced in size to five 4
	byte words rather than ten. The current implementation uses the first
	two leaving the other three unused.

	There are several advantages to moving the workspace:

	1) The new position is consistent for both static and dynamic binaries
	(something I require for a project).
	2) If the number of program headers change, the workspace position
	will not change.
	3) If a non standard linker script is used, the workspace will not
	disappear.
	4) Hopefully future proof against extensions to the ELF header.

	The only minor disadvantage is that shared libraries also acquire the
	workspace 'hole' immediately after the ELF header, however, it is only
	an extra 20 bytes and it may even be useful in the future.

Tue Jan  1 16:42:05 2008  Lee Noar  <leenoar@sky.com>

	* som_register.c: Use RT_WORKSPACE_START instead of magic number.
	* som_array.c: Likewise.
	* som_workspace.h: Define RT_WORKSPACE_START as an address rather
	than an offset.

Tue Nov 27 07:11:25 CET 2007  Peter Naulls  <peter@chocky.org>

	* som_runcom.c: Fix problem when no arguments were given.

Wed Oct  3 19:11:01 2007  Lee Noar  <leenoar@sky.com>

	* Makefile.am: Make sure -mmodule is passed to the linker.

Tue Oct  2 22:33:43 CET 2007  John Tytgat  <John.Tytgat@aaug.net>

Thu Aug 30 01:45:19 CET 2007  John Tytgat  <John.Tytgat@aaug.net>

	* som_os_swis.h: cleaned up the reidentation mess of the inline
	assembler code.

Fri Aug 24 23:53:23 CET 2007  John Tytgat  <John.Tytgat@aaug.net>

	* som_startapp.s(som_start_app): make use of OS_TaskControl when
	available to flatten the SVC stack.

Tue Aug 21 02:24:37 CET 2007  John Tytgat  <John.Tytgat@aaug.net>

	Using autotools to do the building.
	* configure.ac, Makefile.am: new.
	* Makefile: removed.

Fri Aug 17 23:08:28 CET 2007  John Tytgat  <John.Tytgat@aaug.net>

	* som_register.c(som_deregister_client): set client's
	rt_workspace_CLIENT_STRUCT_PTR to 0 to indicate succesful
	deregistration.

Wed Aug 15 20:45:46 CET 2007  John Tytgat  <John.Tytgat@aaug.net>

	* som_runcom.c(command_run): we can't return from this routine with an
	error after having called os_start_app() as otherwise the error "Not a
	heap block: FileSwitch FreeArea" is given instead (on RO 6.06).

Mon Aug 06 20:40:59 2007  Lee Noar  <leenoar@sky.com>

	* som_array.c(somarray_add_object(): Recycle object array elements
	that were previously used by an object that has since expired.

Mon Aug 06 19:35:48 2007  Lee Noar  <leenoar@sky.com>

	* som_register.c(som_deregister_client): Fix memory leak.

Sun Aug 05 13:48:40 2007  Lee Noar  <leenoar@sky.com>

	* somanager.cmhg, som_runcom.c: Exit gracefully if a shared library is
	run.

Tue Jul 17 19:44:48 2007  Lee Noar  <leenoar@sky.com>

	* elf_file.c, elf_file.h (elffile_load): Make bss zeroing optional.
	(elffile_from_memory): New function - fill in an elf_file structure
	from an ELF image already in memory.
	* som_runcom.c: Make dynamic loader file info more available (within
	this file) and generally simplify code.

Sat Jul 14 19:44:35 2007  Lee Noar  <leenoar@sky.com>

	* elf_file.c, elf_file.h(elffile_open): Work out and store the total
	amount of memory used by the ELF object and the lowest address used as
	stored in the file (although in practice this will be either 0x8000
	for an executable or 0 for a library).
	(elffile_load): Simplify by removing the stack tests and free memory
	tracking. These things don't really belong here as we may wish to load
	an object to somewhere other than application memory. To that end, use
	the supplied argument (which can be NULL for an executable) to
	determine the final load address.
	* som_runcom.c(command_run): Do stack check, etc, here instead.

Fri Jul 06 2007 17:48:19 2007  Lee Noar  <leenoar@sky.com>

	* som_swihandler.c: Incorrect comparison.

Fri Jul 06 2007 17:17:54 2007  Lee Noar  <leenoar@sky.com>

	* som_swihandler.c: Wrong register used for parameter and result.

Fri Jul 06 2007 14:43:21 2007  Lee Noar  <leenoar@sky.com>

	* som.h, somanager.cmhg, som_array.c, som_array.h, som_init.c,
	som_register.c, som_runcom.c, som_swihandler.c, som_workspace.h:
	Rename GOT pointer array to runtime array and extend it to include
	data about the R/W segment of each library. The dynamic loader will be
	able to use this data to do relocations without having to call SWI
	"SOM_QueryObject". This should improve program start up times.

Fri Jul 06 2007 12:29:42 2007  Lee Noar  <leenoar@sky.com>

	* som_utilswis.c: som_query_object(): If the user supplied buffer is
	NULL, don't return an error unless the object is not found. This
	allows the existence of an object in the system to be tested without
	having to supply a buffer.

Sun Jun 17 2007 19:43:39 2007  Lee Noar  <leenoar@sky.com>

	* som_register.c: Remove references to unused runtime workspace
	entries and global data members.

	* som_main.c: Remove references to unused global data members.
	Remove definitions of som_prologue and som_resolver.
	* som_swihandler.c: Remove handler code for som_prologue and
	som_resolver.
	* som_runcom.c: Remove references to unused runtime workspace entries.
	* som_workspace.h: Remove unused workspace entries.

Sun Jun 17 2007 18:28:24 2007  Lee Noar  <leenoar@sky.com>

	* Makefile: Use the build directory for object files and generally
	expand into a fuller makefile.

Sat Jun 09 2007 22:43:09 2007  Lee Noar  <leenoar@sky.com>

	* som_elf.c: Don't attempt to load a data segment of zero size. Such a
	segment could occur if all data was in the .bss section.

Fri Jun 08 2007 22:28:06 2007  Lee Noar  <leenoar@sky.com>

	* som.h: Move basic types to separate header file som_types.h to avoid
	cyclic dependencies. Add new member to client structure to record GOT
	ptrs of all libraries used by client. Add new member to object
	structure to record position of object in object/GOT ptr array. Add
	new member to global structure to record object ptrs of all libraries
	known to the system.
	(FIND_CLIENT): Instead of storing an ID in the workspace area of the
	client and searching for it here, just store the client structure
	pointer instead and return that.
	* som_array.c, som_array.h: Implementation of a simple array type that
	is used to manage the object/GOT ptrs at runtime.
	* som_register.c(init_object): Initialise new object index member.
	(copy_object): Likewise.
	(som_register_client): Set workspace client ptr. Initialise the client
	GOT with object index and GOT array location (this requires the
	extended GOT header).
	(som_register_sharedobject): Add the object to the global object
	array.
	* som_final.c: Free the global object array.
	* som_init.c: Initialise the global object array.
	* somanager.cmhg: Add SWI "GenerateGOTArray" to the list.
	* som_command.c(command_status): Output the object index to aid
	debugging.
	* Makefile: Add new file to build.
	* som_main.c(som_callback_handler): When an object expires, clear its
	entry in the global object array (these could be reused in the
	future).
	* som_swihandler.c: Handle SWI "GenerateGOTArray".
	* som_runcom.c(register_client): When you've found the GOT, you don't
	keep looking.
	(command_run): When the Dynamic Loader has registered, generate the
	client's GOT array, so that the DL can function correctly.
	* som_workspace.h: Add 2 new workspace entries at the beginning of the
	list; first is the client's GOT pointer array which will be accessed
	by the PIC code. Its position as the first entry in the workspace is
	important. Second is the client structure pointer which will replace
	the client ID. Other entries in this list will probably become
	obsolete and be removed in the future.
	* som_startapp.s: Typo.

Thu Jun 07 2007 23:13:46 2007  Lee Noar  <leenoar@sky.com>

	* som_os_swis.h: Add heap_extend_block() and heap_block_size() to
	inlined heap SWIs.
	* som_alloc.c, som_alloc.h: Add som_extend() to allow a memory
	allocation to be resized.
	* som_elf.c, som_elf.h, som_startapp.h, som_register.h,
	som_utilswis.h, som_utilswis.c: Add author info.

Sat May 19 2007 14:18:25 2007  Lee Noar  <leenoar@sky.com>

	* som_elf.c: Make sure that if there's an error, the same memory isn't
	freed twice.

Fri May 18 2007 22:26:11 2007  Lee Noar  <leenoar@sky.com>

	* link_list.h: Remove reference to __STDDEF_H.

Sat Apr 28 22:03:31 2007  Lee Noar  <leenoar@sky.com>

	* som_alloc.c: Fix mistake made in som_free().
