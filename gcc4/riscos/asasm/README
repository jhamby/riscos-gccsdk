             README for 'asasm', formally known as 'as'
             ------------------------------------------

'asasm' started as a 'simple assembler' and was written by Niklas Röjemo under
the name 'as' of !AS in its Desktop version.  A non desktop version was created
for an Unix port by Andy Duplain and used in that form as backend assembler in the
GCC/GNAT Ada RISC OS ports.

Over time missing features like macro support were added and the emulation of
Acorn objasm's behavior was improved.

In 2005 the 'asasm' ('as') license changed to GPL v2 after kind permission of
Niklas Röjemo.

Currently 'asasm'/'as' is part of GCCSDK project (http://gccsdk.riscos.info/)
and its development continues there. After David Marston contribution, ELF output
is now possible allowing objasm compatible assembler files to be used by GCCSDK 4
which is purely ELF and no longer AOF based like GCCSDK 3.

Over time there were various contributors (most probably this list is not complete):

  - Niklas Röjemo: main author.
  - Andy Duplain: Unix port.
  - Nick Burrett, Simon Callan, Peter J. Burwood: various improvements needed for
    their GCC/GNAT Ada RISC OS ports
  - Darren Salt: macro support.
  - David Marston: ELF output.
  - Peter Naulls, John-Mark Bell, John Tytgat, Tony van der Hoff,
    Timothy Baldwin, ...
