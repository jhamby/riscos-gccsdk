UnixLib developer notes:

Building
~~~~~~~~

A set of build options specifying which parts of UnixLib are to be included,
which runtime sanity checks needs to be done, etc are specified at
libunixlib/include/unixlib/buildoptions.h.


Calling conventions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The implemented calling convention is APCS-32, i.e. an ARM ABI which allows
the same binary to be run on 26-bit and 32-bit ARM processors (non-thumb).

We noticed that there is a difference in APCS-32 ABI used by UnixLib and
Norcrof C compiler v5 (anyone having a formal specification ?):

  - float arguments: float and double arguments are passed via non-floating
    point registers.  GCCSDK/UnixLib assign one register for a float
    argument while Norcroft assigns two (so basically not making a difference
    between float and double argument.
    Note that a floating point return value is always done via floating point
    register F0.

This difference in APCS-32 implementation becomes important for the SCL stub
interface code as SCL assumes a Norcroft APCS-32 implementation so some float
argument juggling is sometimes needed.
