/****************************************************************************
 * This file implements a heap that sits in application space and is intended
 * for allocating stack chunks.
 * The heap is split into blocks, and all memory is allocated in multiples of
 * the block size.
 * Each block has room for 4K of data, plus 8 bytes of overhead.
 * The top and bottom blocks in the heap are dummy blocks of 4 bytes each,
 * which give the appearance of being allocated blocks. This simplifies the
 * checking needed when trying to coalesce blocks.
 * Free blocks are coalesced where possible into groups of consecutive free
 * blocks. The linked list of free blocks contains only the first block in
 * each such group. The final block in each group contains a pointer to the
 * first block in the group.
 *
 * This file should be compiled without stack checking, as it is not
 * reentrant.
 *
 * Warning: __stackalloc and __stackfree must not use more than 256 bytes
 *          of stack space
