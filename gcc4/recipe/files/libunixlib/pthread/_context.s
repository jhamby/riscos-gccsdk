@ Low level context switching code

@ Written by Martin Piper and Alex Waugh

@ For a single tasking program (not running in a taskwindow), the context
@ switcher works as follows:
@ OS_CallEvery is used to cause an interrupt every centisecond. This interrupt
@ could occur at any time, so we might be in the middle of a SWI call.
@ Therefore a callback is set, so when the SWI returns, or when the callevery
@ routine returns if a SWI call was not taking place, the callback handler is
@ invoked. (A transient callback cannot be used as this might be called when
@ RISC OS is idleing, eg. in an OS_ReadC call.)
@ The callback handler saves all integer and floating point register values
@ in the thread's context save area, and then calls the scheduler
@ (__pthread_context_switch) which decides which thread to run next. The
@ register values (including the saved program counter) from this new thread
@ are then loaded from the thread's context save area into the appropriate
@ registers, thus restoring that thread to where is was before it was switched
@ out, and returning from the callback at the same time.
@ If a routine does not want to be switched out, the it can call
@ __pthread_disable_ints or __pthread_protect_unsafe which will alter
@ __pthread_work_semaphore. The callevery interrupt will still occur, but it
@ will take note of the state of the semaphore, and not set a callback
