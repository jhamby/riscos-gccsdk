About
-----

This is the free version of LibFile.

Libfile is an archiver tool for building libraries
from AOF files that can be passed to link/ld.
It is a free replacement for the libfile program provided
with Acorn's C/C++ and is intended to be a supplement to
the gcc package.

I have been using it for several weeks and it does very well.
If you should come across any problems please tell me and I
will correct them as soon as possible.

To make the use of LibFile easier and more understandable its
behaviour differs from the original tool in the following cases:

- A file that is added to a library keeps its original timestamp
  and is restored to this when it is extracted.
  
- A library always has a symbol table that is kept up to date
  on every operation, simply ignoring non-AOF files.
  There is no need for the option -o anymore.
  If you want to add a symbol table to an existing library use
  'LibFile -c <library file>'.
  
- LibFile always creates all directories that are included in a
  filename when the file is extracted.

- Extracted files are always set to type 0xFFD (Data), since there
  is no filetype information in the library.
  (Don't know what the original LibFile does)


Ultra-short introduction
------------------------

The command for creating a simple library is:

LibFile -c library file1 file2 file3 ...

Use LibFile -? for a short summary of available options.
