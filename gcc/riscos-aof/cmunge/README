This is a modified version of CMunge for use in the GCCSDK project.  The
original sources are and should be stored and tagged in the
'CMungeImportBranch' CVS branch. Then they are merged to one of the GCCSDK
development/stable branches where all the GCCSDK specific changes & bug
fixes are done.

Do not do any bug fixes or changes in the 'CMungeImportBranch' branch
except for importing newer offical CMunge source releases.

The official sources in the 'CMungeImportBranch' CVS branch are labeled
using 'CMunge-X_YZ' tags where 'X_YZ' is the 'Module_MajorVersion_CMHG'
#define value in the 'VersionNum' file but having its dot character
changed into a underscore character.

The GCCSDK build system will automatically create an unified difference
file based on the 'CMunge-X_YZ' tag (derived from the 'VersionNum' file
in the current sandbox) during stage2 building and store that difference
file as 'Docs/GCCSDKModifications'.  All the files inside the 'Docs'
directory (including the generated 'Docs/GCCSDKModifications' file) should
be distributed together with the binary cmunge version in our GCCSDK
binary releases if we want to be compliant with CMunge license outlined
in its 'Docs/Copyright' file.
