This is a copy of CMunge for use in the GCCSDK project.  The original
sources are and should be stored and tagged in the
'svn://svn.riscos.info/gccsdk/branches/CMungeImportBranch/gcc/riscos-aof/cmunge'
SVN branch. Then they are merged to one of the GCCSDK development/stable
branches where all the GCCSDK specific changes & bug fixes are done.

Do not make any bug fixes or changes in the 'CMungeImportBranch' branch
except for importing newer offical CMunge source releases.

The official sources in the 'CMungeImportBranch' CVS branch are labeled
using 'svn://svn.riscos.info/gccsdk/tags/CMunge-X_YZ' tags where 'X_YZ'
is the 'Module_MajorVersion_CMHG' #define value in the 'VersionNum'
file but having its dot character changed into a underscore character.

Doing this in a consistent way allows us to easily find out what the
GCCSDK specific changes are in the CMunge GCCSDK version.

CMunge v0.67 onwards contains nearly all the specific changes needed
for the GCCSDK project and apart from:

  - a GCCSDK specific Makefile
  - marked "[GCCSDK " __VERSION__ "]" via the CMunge printf() in main()
  - using libscl as runtime library
  - hiding RISC OS specific build files (Makefile,fe1, !Mk*,fd7 files)

no additional changes are made.

When such changes would be needed in the future, please read the
CMunge licence (the 'Docs/Copyright' file) carefully and follow it, like
submitting your changes back to the CMunge authors.  The CMunge authors
expressed their wish not to make any incompatible changes to the GCCSDK
CMunge version.
