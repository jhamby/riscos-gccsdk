Resgen
~~~~~~

1. What ?
-------

A tool to create an AOF file encapsulating one or more files ready for
(de)registering with ResourceFS.  All files are stored in one 32-bit CODE
READONLY area together with a global routine which is exported and can
be called to give you a pointer to the begining of the ResourceFS data
block holding the contents of those given files.

2. How ?
------

resgen <areaname> <output file> [ <local file> <ResourceFS name> ]*

E.g.

  $ resgen resourcefsdata resgen.o dat/file1 $.ThirdParty.GCCSDK.Example.file1 dat/file2 $.ThirdParty.GCCSDK.Example.file2

This will create the AOF file 'resgen.o' contain a 32-bit CODE READONLY area
named 'resourcefsdata' holding the file contents of files dat/file1 and
dat/file2 in a ResourceFS structure ready to be registered as
Resources:$.ThirdParty.GCCSDK.Example.file1 and
Resources:$.ThirdParty.GCCSDK.Example.file2 respectively.

To get access to that area, you can call the following generated routine
(you have to declare the function prototype yourself) :

  void *resourcefsdata(void);

I.e. the function name is the same as the given areaname.

The returned value is supposed to be used with SWIs ResourceFS_RegisterFiles
(&41B40), ResourceFS_DeregisterFiles (&41B41) and service call
Service_ResourceFSStarting (&60).
