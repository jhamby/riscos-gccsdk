Hello,
Here is the source code for Drlink. Everything you need is here.
It is set up to compile for use under RISCOS. Apart from modifying
a couple of '#define's, the code runs unchanged under RISCOS,
RiscBSD and Linux.
 
The file 'internals' gives some detail of the code.
 
Just to repeat the conditions under which I am letting
you have ther source:

1) I, that is, Dave Daniels, retain the copyright to Drlink.

2) You cannot pass a copy of the source code of Drlink to anyone
   except for people actively involved in porting GNU software to
   RISCOS. The same restriction applies to them.

3) You can distribute modified executable versions of Drlink 
   with the GNU compilers as long as they are marked as such.

4) Drlink is not to be distributed under the GNU Public
   License (GPL). I believe that the GPL says that that any
   software that uses components that are subject to the GPL
   must themselves be distributed under the GPL. I believe
   this means that it must be supplied in source form.
   
5) You must let me have copies of any changed versions of the
   source code.

If you have any questions or anything, please do not hesitate to
ask me.

Dave Daniels
