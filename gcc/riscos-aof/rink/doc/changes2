****************************************************************************

rink_load is used to load a segment.

   os_error *rink_load(char *segment_name, char *links_name,
      rink_seghandle *sh, rink_check *ck)

It returns a handle to the segment for use with future calls to the system
in *sh, and returns 0 to signify that no error occured.

The pointer to the error block is either an operting system error, or a rink
internal error. These can be translated by the parent application by using
rinkptr to create a sugar function to a translation function other than the
default.

ck is a pointer to a structure. This must match the header of the file to be
loaded as a check that the file is the right thing to be loading. The
segment will be rejected if the main version number is greater than that
given. The code version number is ignored, and is merely for information
only.


Version numbers can be read with rink_readversion().


****************************************************************************

rink_readversion returns a pointer to a structure containing the version
numbers of a segment.

   rink_version *rink_readversion(rink_seghandle sh);

[...]

The default error translator returns a pointer to an error block with a
textual message in english, and the error number as err_number. Values for
err_number can be

Number  Default message
  -1    "No room"
  -2    "Not a rink segment"
  -3    "Not a rink links file"
  -4    "Segment is too recent"
