Notes on my test program:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

files beginning with 'test' in the c directory are my test files. they might
give you some clues as to what I'm on about.

test should be compiled and linked with o.pointerblk and o.rink_rtsys

test1 - 3 should be compiled and rinked together with the header described
in the file 'headerDesc'.
