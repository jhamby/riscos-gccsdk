Notes on the demo program supplied
rink documentation, (c) Ben Summers 1995


The demo program is a simple program written in C which loads two segments
and calls some functions in them. It shows how data and functions in the main
program can be accessed by the segments.

You require Acorn C v5 to make this program. Ensure you've installed rink,
copy the demo directory out of the archive and double click on !Make within
it. It should refuse to run if you attempt to run it from the distribution
archive. The language tools cc, link and amu are required to make the demo
program.

The variable C$Path should be set up to include the directory which contains
o.stubs - the !Boot program installed by Acorn C should set this up for you.

Once it has been made without error, double click !Run to run it.


The demonstration program caches pointers to functions in the segments in a
common structure. This is the recommended method, although you could also
call a function using rink_fn suitably casted.
