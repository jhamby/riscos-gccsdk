	* Changed #define tests on __riscos__ into CROSS_COMPILE tests.
	* Makefile: OBJS in alphabetic order.
	* asm.{c,h}: asm_() -> assemble()
	* commands.c, include.{c,h}: No longer using FILE ptr to
	  canonicalise to full path via OSArgs 7.  This fixes bug #132.
	* depend.c: Made it more robust; Added dependInit() and
	  dependFinish().
	* error.c: Output Throwback errors when verbose is set.
	* filestack.{c,h}, whileif.h: Removed fileNo, fileCurrentNo (wasn't
	  really used).
	* os.{h,s}: Removed unused bits; Made APCS-32 compliant.
	* version.h: Bumped version to 1.42.

	* Removed leading underscores of the preprocessor defines preventing
	  cyclic includes.
	* Changed 0 -> NULL for NULL pointers.
	* Constify several variables, function parameters and struct
	  elements.
	* Various fixes to avoid Norcroft compiler warnings.
	* Identifiers starting with '#' are now allowed, except when they
	  are followed by a space, one or more digits and a space.
	* Made ELF code compile conditional (NO_ELF_SUPPORT).
	* Moved all global option variable declaration into main.h.
	* lex.c: Added lexPrint() for debugging purposes.
	* main.c: Using EXIT_SUCCESS/EXIT_FAILURE as return values; Better
	  option parsing.
	* value.c: Added valuePrint() for debugging purposes.
	* version.h: Increased version number from 1.40 to 1.41.
	* whileif.c: Body of WHILE {TRUE} was incorrectly executed once.
