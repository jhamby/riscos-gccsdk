                         MPN TEST PROGRAMS


This directory contains programs designed to exercise various mpn
subroutines.  Nothing here is built or installed, nor even run in a "make
check", but there's Makefile rules to build each program, or "allprogs" to
build everything.

All the programs here are meant only for use during development and casual
GMP users are unlikely to find anything of interest.
