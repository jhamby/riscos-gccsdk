Summary of Changes
==================

02 Jan 2001
-----------

* Clean up of some old junk files.
* Build riscos-progs/diff.

01 Jan 2001
-----------

* Huge makefile overhaul.  We now build two versions of gcc.  One is
  a cross-compiler, the other is a complete RISC OS distribution.
* Added original RISC OS documentation and distribution files.  This
  is all contained within riscos-dist.
* Added documentation for gcc, g77 and gpc.
* Bugfix to UnixLib's memcpy function that practically broke all
  cross-compiled applications.
* Simplified GCC's multilib options.
* Import Ben Summers' run-time linker (rink) into the source tree under
  riscos-aof.  Enough code has been fixed to get the tools compiling,
  but it hasn't been tested.

28 Dec 2000
-----------

* Minor build fixes.
* Make appropriate changes to autoconf so that we can build the gccsdk
  on different processors.
* Fixed six reported Fortran 77 bugs.

27 Dec 2000
-----------

* Add support into the pre-processor for RISC OS filenames that contain
  path elements.
* Fix Makefile bug that stopped the Fortran compiler being built.
* Build the Objective-C and Java compilers.
* Programs in `riscos-progs' are only build if we are on RISC OS.
* Conversion to autoconf for top-level configuration.  This actually
  makes portability much easier.

22 Dec 2000
-----------

* Remove automatically generated files from CVS tree.
* Seperate Makefile configuration into operating system dependent files
* Tweak makefiles to create object and installation directories and also
  install library header files.
