Welcome to GCC 3.4.4 release 3 for RISC OS.

This document covers important notes for new users and existing users alike.
GCC and UnixLib have undergone many changes, so it's important that you read
this document fully.

If you're new to GCC:

 - The !gcc application contains everything you need to get started
   programming in RISC OS.  Although it possible to mix and match,
   in particular with Acorn's C/C++, this is not recommened for beginners.

   To get started using GCC, read !gcc.docs.Intro


If you've used GCC before:

- The standard C++ library has been re-written from GCC 2.95.4.  Any existing
  C++ applications and libraries will require re-compiling before
  interoperability can be achieved if they were compiled prior to version
  3.3.3 of GCC.

- The C++ compiler does not specify the 'std' namespace by default.  To use
  functions defined within the standard C++ library you must now either
  explicitly declare 'using namespace std' at the head of your source file, or
  explicitly prepend 'std::' to all function and variable references.

- The file !gcc.Changes lists major changes from the last version.
  !gcc.docs.UnixLib.Changes has a comprehensive list of changes to UnixLib.


Future Versions of GCC:

  Although we intend to continue maintaining GCC 3.4 for RISC OS,
  new versions of GCC 4.1 for RISC OS will soon be available, which
  will be ELF and soft-float based.  We are also working on a shared
  library system.

  Special thanks to the following people having written programs which are
  used in the GCCSDK project :
  
  - Niklas Röjemo for his 'as' AOF assembler.
  - Justin Fletcher and Robin Watts for 'CMunge', a free alternative to CMHG.
  - Andy Duplain for his 'decaof', an AOF decoder.
  - Dave Daniels for his 'drlink', an AOF linker.
  - Bernhard Walter for his 'libfile', an AOF library archiver.
  - Ben Summers for his 'rink', an dynamic AOF loader.

  Thanks also to all the testers and bug reporters.

  And last but not least, all the GCC contributers.
