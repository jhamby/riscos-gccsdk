Welcome to the latest version of GCC for RISC OS.

This document covers important notes for new users and existing users alike.
GCC and Unixlib have undergone many changes, so it's important that you read
this document fully.

If you're new to GCC:

 - The !gcc application contains everything you need to get started
   programming in RISC OS.  Although it possible to mix and match,
   in particular with Acorn's C/C++, this is not recommened for beginners.

   To get started using GCC, read !gcc.docs.Intro


If you've used GCC before:

 - You will probably have !UnixLib and/or !Clib applications.  These are no
   longer required, as their functionality has been incorporated into the !gcc
   application, so you should delete them.
  
   We strongly discourage continuing to use older versions of GCC, as there
   are many issues related to it.  We do not know of *any* reason not to use
   the new version over any old version.  As such, reporting bugs on old
   versions of GCC or Unixlib will not gain you any sympathy.
  
   On the other hand, if you have any problems with this version, we'd like
   to hear about them as soon as possible.  

 - Ensure you don't have any old versions of GCC-related utilities in your
   RISC OS Library path.   In particular, Drlink.

 - The previously named -mstubs flag has changed to -mlibscl, to tell GCC
   to link against SharedCLibrary instead of UnixLib.

 - You can now automatically set the use of a Dynamic Area as heap with
   Unixlib, and set that area's name by adding code like the following:

      const char *__dynamic_da_name = "Nettle Heap";

 - You may have noticed that GCC now ships with a new module
   "SharedUnixLibrary", which is currently used as a solution to the long-
   standing "UpCall handler bug".  If you wish to distribute any UnixLib
   programs, then you'll also need to distribute this module - probably
   in the same way GCC does in a !System skeleton.

   There is no need to RMEnsure this in your !Run file as UnixLib itself
   ensures the module is loaded.  If you do distribute the module it is
   highly recommended that you watch future GCC and UnixLib developments
   as it is possible that future versions of the module and Unixlib
   may be incompatible with the current versions.  There is no need
   to RMEnsure this in your !Run file as UnixLib itself ensures the module
   is loaded.
