Welcome to GCC 3.3.3 for RISC OS.

This document covers important notes for new users and existing users alike.
GCC and Unixlib have undergone many changes, so it's important that you read
this document fully.

If you're new to GCC:

 - The !gcc application contains everything you need to get started
   programming in RISC OS.  Although it possible to mix and match,
   in particular with Acorn's C/C++, this is not recommened for beginners.

   To get started using GCC, read !gcc.docs.Intro


If you've used GCC before:

- The standard C++ library has been re-written.  Any existing C++ applications
  and libraries will require re-compiling before interoperability can be
  achieved.

- The C++ compiler does not specify the 'std' namespace by default.  To use
  functions defined within the standard C++ library you must now either
  explicitly declare 'using namespace std' at the head of your source file, or
  explicitly prepend 'std::' to all function and variable references.
