RISC OS GCC pre-release 3a  (released 23 November 1999)
==========================

* Integer division will now raise a SIGFPE upon division
  by zero

* Front-end programs g77 and g++ had not been built since the
  upgrade to 2.95.2 and were looking for the compilers in
  directory 2_95_1.
  
* The !run file incorrectly set the pathname for the /tmp
  directory.

RISC OS GCC pre-release 3  (released 19 November 1999)
=========================

These are the user visible changes since pre-release 2.

* Updated to GCC 2.95.2

* C++: The Standard Template Library headers have been moved from
  their own sub-directory (stl) to their parent directory.

* Fix errors in the conversion of float/double and long doubles
  to 64-bit integers. These functions have been re-coded to not
  use floating-point instructions.

* as: The assembler incorrectly compiled a post-indexed LDR/STR
  as a pre-indexed LDR/STR.

* as: Incorrect filename translation was causing AOF files
  named o.s_temp to be written out as o.o_temp

* unixlib: Bug fixes in UnixLib's strsep and strtoul functions.
  Implemented C9X headers, fenv.h and complex.h. Added many new
  math functions.

RISC OS GCC pre-release 2  (released 23 September 1999)
=========================

This file details the user visible changes since pre-release 1.

* Separate libgcc runtime library for targetting the SharedCLibrary
called libgcc_sh.

* Exception handling bug fix.

* Transparent suffix swapping performed by UnixLib is now private
to the GCC compilers and utilities (set by UnixFS$<progname>$sfix)

* Directory structure has been reorganised. Binaries and
supporting libraries are now in version specific directories so
it will be possible to have multiple gcc installations and select
an appropriate compiler by it's version number (see `gcc -V').

* C++ support libraries libio and libstdc++ are now integrated
into the main !gcc tree, rather than being separate directories.
Hence it is no longer a requirement to add -Ilibio: and -Ilibstdc:
to the gcc command line, likewise with -Llibio: and -Llibstdc:
on the linker command line, however you still will need to add
-lstdc++ and -liostream.

* The C++ libraries should now be compatible with the long
file name feature of RISC OS 4. This shouldn't affect users of
filing systems that support only 10 characters i.e. ADFS, IDEFS
and SCSIFS on RISC OS 3.

* The example programs originally located in !gcc.files have been
moved out of the !gcc directory. Running !gcc will no longer
change the currently selected directory.

* Documentation update to reflect directory structure changes.
Added a clear note regarding the memory usage of gcc.
