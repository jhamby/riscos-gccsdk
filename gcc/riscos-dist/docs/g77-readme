The GNU Fortran compiler
========================

Introduction
------------

This is a port of the GNU Fortran compiler (version 0.5.25) for the 
Fortran 77 and 90 programming language dialects to the range of ARM
based machines running under RISC OS. As such, this package is
covered by the FSF General Public License (see the files docs.COPYING
and docs.COPYINGLIB in the full GCCSDK package for details).

This port is © 1996, 1997, 1998, 1999, 2000, 2001 Nick Burrett
             © 2002, 2003, 2004, 2005 GCCSDK Developers

As with GNU programs, THERE IS NO WARRANTY OF ANY SORT

This compiler requires a minimum 4000KB of free RAM for compilations.


Files
-----

This is a binary distribution only and consists of the following files:

  !gcc.bin.g77
     The Fortran compiler front end
  !gcc.bin.arm-riscos-aof.3_4.f771
     The Fortran compiler
  !gcc.bin.arm-riscos-aof.3_4.apcs32.abs.unixlib.o.libg2c
     Fortran compiler runtime library based on UnixLib
  !gcc.bin.arm-riscos-aof.3_4.apcs32.abs.libscl.o.libg2c
     Fortran compiler runtime library based on SharedCLibrary
  !gcc.docs.g77
     Fortran compiler instruction manual
  !gcc.docs.g77-readme
     This documentation

The compiler sources can be obtained from the GCCSDK site at
http://gccsdk.riscos.info/.


Installation
------------

This binary distribution can not be used standalone and other components
of the GCCSDK package are needed.  The full GCCSDK package can be
downloaded (as several parts) from http://gccsdk.riscos.info/.


Compiling Fortran source
------------------------

Fortran source files can be kept in either the 'for' or 'f' directories.

Fortran comes with an extra file called g77. g77 is a front end binary for
the Fortran compiler, and will automatically include the necessary run-time
library needed by Fortran whenever the compilation needs it.

Typing:
    gcc -c f.test
or  gcc -c test.f
or  g77 -c f.test
or  g77 -c test.f

will compile the Fortran file, test, into an AOF file and store it in the
'o' directory.

Typing:
    gcc -o test -lg2c o.test
or  gcc -o test -lg2c test.o

will link o.test AOF file (you can specify more than one AOF file) into
the executable 'test'.

Typing:
    gcc f.test -o test -lg2c
or  gcc test.f -o test -lg2c
or  g77 f.test -o test
or  g77 test.f -o test

will directly compile your Fortran file into the executable 'test'.
