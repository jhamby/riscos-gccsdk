                                UnixLib 3.8
                                ~~~~~~~~~~~

This document provides a VERY short introduction to UnixLib, and only covers
the RISC OS specific details of using UnixLib. It does not document what
facilites it provides, or how it works. For this you should look at the
various documents elsewhere in this distribution, the source, and a proper
manual.

I can be contacted at :

	unixlib-chief@hard-mofo.dsvr.net

Aternatively, the UnixLib home page is
http://hard-mofo.dsvr.net/unixlib, and this should be checked for
updates and bug-fixes.


Installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Installation is quite simple:

1) Copy the !UnixLib directory to an appropriate location on your hard disc,
and ensure that !UnixLib.!Boot is run during the boot up process.

2) If you have a verison of RiscOS earlier than 3.7, copy the module
CallAWSI.CallASWI to System:modules.

UnixLib and GCC
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

UnixLib is the default library for GCC, and there are no actions that need
to be taken to use this combination.

UnixLib and Norcroft C
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

By default Norcroft C uses the ANSI library that come with the compiler. To
use UnixLib, you have to change its behaviour, by using the following
command switches

        -IUnix: -JUnix: -lUnix:o.UnixLib

If you are using a seperate link stage, the -l switch is not needed, instead
you should specifiy Unix:o.UnixLib in the link command line.

If using the DDE frontend '!CC', the following needs to be changed

The 'Include' field should be changed to 'Unix:'
On the popup menu, the 'Default path' should be set to 'Unix:', while the
'libraries' should be set to 'Unix:o.UnixLib'.

For !Link, Unix:o.UnixLib should be specified as one of the files to be
linked.

Please note that the math functions defined in complex.h cannot be
used if UnixLib is compiled with Norcroft C.
