                                UnixLib 4.0
                                ~~~~~~~~~~~

This document provides a VERY short introduction to UnixLib, and only covers
the RISC OS specific details of using UnixLib. It does not document what
facilites it provides, or how it works. For this you should look at the
various documents elsewhere in this distribution, the source, and a proper
manual (like <URL:http://www.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/007904975/download/>
and <URL:http://www.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/007908799/>).

The UnixLib is part of the RISC OS GCC SDK and its home page is at
<URL:http://hard-mofo.dsvr.net/gcc/>. This should be checked for
updates and bug-fixes.


What
~~~~

UnixLib is a Run-Time Library for the RISC OS based computers that
provides a mixed System V / BSD interface for C and C++ programs.  It
is also an alternative to the "Stubs" and "AnsiLib" libraries supplied
with the Norcroft C compiler.

It is also the default Run-Time Library for the RISC OS port of GCC.

Quoting the original documentation :

    [Unixlib] is a complete replacement ANSI compliant C library for use
    with Acorn RISC OS ANSI C Release 3.0/3.1A/3.1B/4.0. It incorporates
    a subset of the UNIX system call interface and some common System V
    and 4.3 BSD C libraries.

Unixlib was originaly developed by Huw Rogers, up to version 3.6c, after
which Simon Callan took over development. This was mainly triggered by
his work on the port of GCC 2.4.5 to RISC OS. Nick Burrett and Peter
Burwood did a lot of the development work starting at version 3.7b and
working towards 3.8 for their ports of GCC 2.7 and GNAT 3.03 respectively.
Additional help along the way has been provided by Nick Clark and
John Tytgat. Peter Naulls and Alex Waugh contributed significantly to
create 4.0 which features 32-bit compliancy and pthread support.

Unixlib is covered with various licenses but freely usable for
non-commercial programs. For commercial use, and usage of parts of the
source code, please contact the UnixLib developers. In most cases there
will be no charges or restrictions. 


Installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Installation is quite simple:

1) Copy the !UnixLib directory to an appropriate location on your hard disc,
and ensure that !UnixLib.!Boot is run.  Running !UnixLib.!Boot is normally
done by the Filer when seeing the !UnixLib directory for the first time.

2) If you develop on RISC OS earlier than 3.7, make sure you have the
CallASWI module installed in your !System directory.  The latest known
version is 0.03 and can be found at
<URL:http://www.iyonix.com/32bit/CallASWI.shtml>.

3) The module "SharedUnixLibrary" needs to be copied as
!System.310.Modules.SharedULib.  In !UnixLib you can find the sources of
this module.


Distributing of UnixLib based programs
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When your program is linked with UnixLib, it needs the "SharedUnixLibrary"
module.  We advise to ship together with your product the following
directory tree !System.310.Modules containing a copy of the
"SharedUnixLibrary" module as file "SharedULib".  Users can use the
!System merger to make sure they have the latest version of this module.

If you intend your program to run on versions of RISC OS older than 3.7,
you should also provide an installation note or program to install the
CallASWI module as !System.Modules.CallASWI.  Or, even better, redirect
the users to <URL:http://www.iyonix.com/32bit/CallASWI.shtml> for the
latest known version and approved installation program.


UnixLib and GCC
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

UnixLib is the default library for GCC, and there are no actions that need
to be taken to use this combination.


UnixLib and Norcroft C
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

By default Norcroft C uses the ANSI library that come with the compiler. To
use UnixLib, you have to change its behaviour, by using the following
command switches

        -IUnixLib: -JUnixLib: -lUnixLib:o.UnixLib

If you are using a seperate link stage, the -l switch is not needed, instead
you should specifiy UnixLib:o.UnixLib in the link command line.

If using the DDE frontend '!CC', the following needs to be changed

The 'Include' field should be changed to 'UnixLib:'
On the popup menu, the 'Default path' should be set to 'UnixLib:', while the
'libraries' should be set to 'UnixLib:o.UnixLib'.

For !Link, UnixLib:o.UnixLib should be specified as one of the files to be
linked.

Please note that the math functions defined in complex.h cannot be
used if UnixLib is compiled with Norcroft C.
