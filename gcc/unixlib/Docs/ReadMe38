				UnixLib 3.8
				~~~~~~~~~~~

The following details some of the more noticable changes that have
been made to UnixLib since version 3.7b.

* NetLib code has been tested and works. It is no longer an option to
  leave out this code.

* 'printf' and 'scanf' have been ported from BSD 4.3. 'printf' output is
  now ANSI conformat and floating point numbers are correctly rounded
  and very accurate. 'scanf' now supports scan-sets.

* 'strtod' has been ported from BSD 4.3. It is a very accurate
  implementation.

* 'stpcpy', 'stpncpy' are new functions. These copy a string and return a
  pointer to the terminating null character.

* Character Localisation (locale) has been implemented and uses the
  Territory Manager for the underlying features. Functions include
  'localeconv', 'setlocale', 'strcoll' and 'strxfrm'.

* The time functions have been re-written. These now use the Territory
  Manager for underlying support, as well as being integrated with the
  locale support. Daylight saving time is now supported and POSIX features
  have been added to 'strftime'.

* The ctype functions now support locale.

* Math support has been extended to provide most of the features of libm.
  New functions include 'cbrt', 'erf', 'expm1', 'fmod', 'ilogb', 'j0',
  'j1', 'jn', 'lgamma', 'log1p', 'logb', 'nextafter', 'remainder',
  'rem_pio2', 'rint', 'scalbn', 'significand', 'isinf', 'isnan',
  'finite', 'copysign'.  Existing math functions now produce answers
  accurate to 1 unit in the last place.

* Standard input/output has been re-written. A restriction of the number of
  stdio streams that can be opened has been removed. The new limit is
  memory, the underlying operating system (RISC OS) and the number of
  file descriptors available.  Many bugs have been fixed.

* The code behind the implemention of file descriptors has been largely
  re-written.  Currently, the maximum number of file descriptors that
  can be opened is set at 64, but it is easy to extend this to millions.
  Many bugs have been fixed.

* The directory reading functions have been re-written.  The number of
  directories that can be opened using 'opendir' is now limited by memory.

* New POSIX features have been added: 'fnmatch', 'getopt', 'getsubopt',
  'glob' and 'uname'.

* Command line parsing has been improved. Filenames of the form
  '<test$dir>.fred' are no longer interpreted as redirecting standard input
  to read from the file 'test$dir>.fred'.

* The mmap associated function calls have been implemented for RISC OS
  users that have dynamic area support.

* Malloc has been updated to Doug Lea's latest version. This will use
  mmap for large allocations (on RISC OS versions that support it).

* 'strtol', 'strtoul' are now accurate

* fcrypt has been added.

* The majority of functions provided by the SharedCLibrary header file
  kernel.h have been implemented.
  
* 'getenv' has been re-written. Environment variables are now correctly
  passed to the child process.

* Extra safeguards have been added to prevent the stack backtrace from
  crashing.

* The header file termio.h has been replaced by the POSIX standard version
  termios.h.

* Filename translation can be turned on or off at run-time by setting a
  system variable.

* Added and implemented complex.h and fenv.h.

* Removed 1024 character command line restriction.

* Improved command line argument parser.
