                        Changes in UnixLib 3.6e
                        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


1)      Correction to cope with negative width specifications in printf
        statements.

2)      Bits to shut the compiler up.

3)      Extra debugging data (internal).

4)      The uname function has been improved to allow for long filenames,
        and filenames with the format 'fred:jim.h'.

5)      The return code from fork()/exec() is now correctly read.

6)      The atan2() function now works better.

7)      Special functions required by C v5 have been added.

8)      The read/write check functions now check for correct word alignment.

9)      A check for the RISC OS version has been removed, as it caused
        problems for !Virtual.

10)     UnixLib now recognises Images as directories.

11)     The times() function has been added.

12)     If the /tmp directory is not specified, UnixLib now defaults to
        <Wimp$ScrapDir>.

13)     Problems with deleting locked files and directories cleared.
