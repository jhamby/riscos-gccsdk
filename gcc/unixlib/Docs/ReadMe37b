		UnixLib 3.7b
		~~~~~~~~~~~~

There have been quite a few changes between UnixLib 3.7a and UnixLib 3.7b,
nearly all of which have been done by Nick Burrett, and Peter Burwood.
Frankly speaking, I have very little idea what these changes are, but they
are essential for GCC and GNAT.

NetLib
~~~~~~

This version of UnixLib also includes the source for an interface to the IP
stack under RISC OS. This was supplied by Sergio Monesi.

The code is totally untested, although it does compile.

To build the Netlib code, copy '!Setup' and 'Makefile' from 'objs' to
'netlib', add 'netlib.!Stamp' to the STAMP variable, and add 'netlib.o.*' to
the libfile command line

Finally, double-click on '!Setup' and run the Makefile.
