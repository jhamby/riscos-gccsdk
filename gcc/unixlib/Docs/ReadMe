                                   =======

Run-time features
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Certain features of UnixLib can be enabled/disabled by defining environment
variables. These can be applied to all UnixLib based applications running
on the system, or to specific programs.

To set globally use
  *Set UnixEnv$<features>

to set per-program use
  *Set UnixEnv$<program name>$<features>

The list of recognised features are:

1. nonametrans

   If set, all file paths and filenames will be used verbatim i.e. without
   the usual Unix to RISC OS conversions.


Link-time features
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There are WEAK'ly defined symbols which can be used to control
certain UnixLib features too.  I.e. those symbols can, but not have to,
be *defined* outside UnixLib and when they are defined, they will be
used by the relevant UnixLib functions.

Its intended use is to provoke as less as possible changes in ported
Unix programs by simply defining an extra RISC OS specific source file
containing just like e.g. :

---8<---
#include <unixlib/local.h>

int __feature_imagefs_is_file = 1;
---8<---

List of current WEAK'ly defined symbols :

1. __riscosify_control

Header file: <unixlib/local.h>, default value 0.
This symbol will control how riscosify[_std]() processes filenames.

2. __feature_imagefs_is_file

Header file: <unixlib/features.h>, default value 0.
When non zero, files with filetypes recognized by an active ImageFS will
be considered as regular files and not as directories.


Compile-time features
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We try to restrict the number of compile-time features so that one
binary release of UnixLib can satisfy most programmers.  These
features, together with a short explanation, are defined in
at the bottom of source.clib.unixlib.h.features.  Note that these
feature settings are also reflected in the source.clib.unixlib.s.asm_dec
file and should be kept in sync at all times.


Stub functions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
A few functions are stub functions.  They are provided in UnixLib
as either placeholders for functions that await implementation or those
that simply cannot be, possibly because they are not relevant to RISC OS.
For a complete list, see the autogenerated file source/clib/unixlib/stubs.h
