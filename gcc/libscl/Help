!Clib - The Shared C Library Header Files
=========================================

This directory contains the necessary header files and object file to
enable programs to use the SharedCLibrary module.

This library is release 1.06 and is Copyright (c) 1997-1999 Nick Burrett

!Clib is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.


NOTE: THIS VERSION OF !CLIB IS A SNAPSHOT OF A WORK IN PROGRESS TO
EXTEND THE CAPABILITIES, ALLOWING THE C++ LIBRARIES TO BE COMPILED
AGAINST IT.

Files
-----

All header files are accessible through the path C: or Clib:

All programs must additionally link with the Acorn Object Format (AOF)
file C:o.stubs (or clib:o.stubs).


Installation
------------

Copy the directory !clib somewhere on your hard disc. Double-clicking on it
will setup the necessary paths, ready for use.

With a slight modification, this library can be used with Easy C and Acorn C.
To do this, you need to obtain the stdarg.h and varargs.h header files
appropriate to your compiler and copy them into !clib.h.stdarg and
!clib.h.varargs. You must also copy the definition of va_list and put it
towards the start of !clib.h.stdio, renaming va_list to __va_list.

Using the SharedCLibrary library
--------------------------------

For general use, all that is needed is an extra command line option to GCC:
  -mstubs
This will force GCC to search the GCC: and C: paths instead of the usual
GCC: and Unix: paths.

The library to link against is c:o.stubs

The following commands will compile the file c.hellow:
  *gcc -c c.hellow -O2 -mstubs
  *drlink -o hellow o.hellow gcc:o.libgcc c:o.stubs

If you use LD, then add '-Lc: -lstubs' to the command line.

Alternatively, let gcc handle the linking as well:
  *gcc c.hellow -O2 -mstubs -o hellow

Filename translation for the Shared C Library
---------------------------------------------
             
The Shared C Library does not benefit from UnixLib's filename translation
code. However, defining the symbol __UNAME before you include stdio.h will
cause remove(), rename(), fopen() and freopen() to use the UnixLib filename
translation code on the filenames supplied as arguments to those functions.

See the GCC and UnixLib documentation for instructions on how to use the
filename translation code, especially the fancy options. Much information is
given in the source, uname.c, provided, which is a hacked version of that
supplied with UnixLib.

Thanks go to Reuben Thomas for the effort here.


Known problems with the filename translation code
-------------------------------------------------

If you use command-line redirection of stdin and stdout, the filenames used
for redirection are not translated. If this is important, use UnixLib.

Directories are not automatically created, so if a file called "junk.o" is
opened when its parent directory does not have a subdirectory called "o" the
attempt will fail.


SharedCLibrary and the CallASWI module
--------------------------------------

Code linked for execution with the SharedCLibrary will not need to have the
CallASWI module distributed with it.
