I have been trying a number of f77 sources with the g77 provided with
GCC2.96, and not having much luck.
There have been a number of problems, mostly related to character strings and
writing to files. When it comes to isolating the problem in a nice succinct
piece of sample code, the problems have become rather elusive.
The example included is the first which I feel i can reasonably pass on as
is. Most of the others are very big programs and I think it is probably best
if I can reproduce the problem in a small bit of code which demonstrates it
without confusing the issue with vast numbers of variables etc.
The program genrd/f misbehaves, in that it doesn't write all that it should
to the output file (unit 1, "fname").
All that is written is the string in the char desc.
I have added a write to unit 6 (stdout), which echos to the screen what is
expected to be written to the file.
The source, less the two writes to unit 6, has been compiling and executing
as expected, without dramas for some years, using the MIPS f77 compiler for
IRIX.
I will keep working away at trying to get some demo code which exhibits soem
of the other problems I have encountered with other f77 source.
